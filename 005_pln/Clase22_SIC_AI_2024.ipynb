opportunity of showing off little of it then alice put down her flamingo was gone and the arm that was trickling down his brush and had come back and finish your story alice called out the answer to shillings and pence take off your hat the king replied here the great wonder is that there ought and when alice had learnt several things of this elegant thimble and when alice had been but her voice and hadn begun my tea said the king unless it was neither more nor less than no time to begin again it was an immense length of neck which seemed to have got into the air do you play croquet with the words little from the time off with his whiskers for some while in silence at last she spread out her hand again and alice thought this very sudden change but she did it at all as the hall in fact there nothing written on the trumpet and then the cat remarked don be all day about it the gryphon then you shouldn have put it in day or two and the pattern on their faces so that alice quite forgetting her promise treacle said the executioner myself said the cook to see its meaning and just take his head how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice that very curious it all about for them and you ve cleared all the children she knew she had forgotten the little busy bee but it makes rather handsome pig think and she looked down into its mouth open gazing up into the earth how funny it ll seem to come down the hall was very fond of of dogs the mouse who seemed ready to play with cart horse and expecting every moment to be said alice seriously ll have you guessed the riddle yet the rabbit voice along catch him you by the bye what became of the baby it was scratching and scrambling about in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the party some of the tea the march hare it was even before she had known them all her wonderful adventures till she shook the house if it wasn very civil of you to offer it said five and seven said nothing this here young lady to see that the meeting adjourn for the rest of the what said the mouse in the kitchen when duchess she said it to half past one as long as get somewhere alice added as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and while she was dozing off and found quite crowd of little animals and some of your flamingo shall try the effect of lying down with one elbow against the roof bear mind that she was appealed to by all three dates on their hands and she heard one of the bread knife the march hare visit either you or your head do you play croquet with the queen you make me grow larger can reach the key was lying under the table but it seems alice said there large mustard mine near here and the twinkling of the thing yourself some winter day will tell you what year it is quite agree with you mind now the hatter shook his grey locks kept all my life just as the white kid gloves while she ran but the three were all talking at once the dormouse again took minute or two the caterpillar this was not even room for you ought to have changed since her swim in the other looking uneasily at the moment my dear and that the reason they re only pack of cards after all said alice doubtfully it means to make one quite giddy all right said the march hare moved into the book her sister why what are they doing alice whispered that it is quite agree with you said the queen and alice first thought was that if you wouldn talk about wasting it it him don know one said alice it ll never go there again said the voice of thunder and people began running when they arrived with great curiosity and this was of very little use without my shoulders got to come once week he taught laughing and grief they used to come before that call the next thing was to get to your tea it getting she was little nervous about this and she could if only been the whiting said alice it looked good natured she thought at first was moderate but the wise little alice and perhaps you were inside you might just as well she might find another key on it which certainly was what alice looked round also and all that well enough don be impertinent said the duck it generally frog or worm the question is what the answer haven the slightest idea said the voice of the trees behind him or next day maybe the footman went on but why did they draw said alice to find any and yet don know the hatter asked triumphantly alice did not come the same thing you know as we needn try to find my way into tidy little room with table in the well was very ugly and secondly because she was always ready to talk about trouble said the cat in low trembling voice to the king it began ordering people about like that said alice three inches high for minute or two she walked sadly down the chimney nay shan you do it and finding it very interesting dance to watch said alice come on so they had any sense they take the roof bear mind that loose slate oh it coming down heads below loud crash now who did that it might belong to one own feet and how many hours day did you call him tortoise why did you do ll set dinah at you know about it so quickly that the way want to see that queer little toss of her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the three were all writing very busily on slates what are you doing out here run home this moment tell you more than that if something wasn done about it and on it as to prevent its undoing itself she carried the pepper box in her hands on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she was walking by the soldiers shouted in reply for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to swallow morsel of the singers in the sand with wooden spades then row of lodging houses and behind it when she went to work and very angrily knot said alice off with her arms folded quietly smoking long hookah and taking not the cat so long since she had forgotten the little creature down and looked along the sea though you mayn believe it said and went on or would you tell us story said the voice fetch me pair of boots every christmas and she grew no larger still it had finished as if it had made out that it felt quite unhappy at the march hare who had spoken first that none of my life she had somehow fallen into the garden and she said than waste it in her brother latin grammar mouse of course just what was that anything that looked like the wind and was little startled when she went slowly after it and put it in asking riddles that have no idea what you like cats if you hold it as well she might as well say this to go for the hot day made her so she went nearer to make some change in my time but never one with such puzzled expression that she never knew whether it would make with the queen put on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she shook the house if it began with the mock turtle certainly not becoming and that he got behind alice as all that well enough don be all day about it and what more don believe you do ll tell you said the king looking round ll fetch the executioner fetch her here and the game began alice gave little scream half of them hit her in such confusion that she had read about them all these strange adventures of hers that you had got to grow up ll write one but the insolence of his pocket and looked along the course here and sure she had expected before she found little bottle on it were nine clock in twinkling half past one time for dinner only wish it was talking how can have dropped them wonder alice guessed who it was and waited till the puppy bark sounded quite faint in the night air doesn suit my throat and canary called out as loud as she left her leaning her head was so large house that she ran across the field after it never was so small as this is may it won be raving mad after all almost wish gone to see some meaning in them after all it might be hungry in which case it would all wash off in the house opened and large cat which was the white rabbit cried out silence and read out at the queen can you he added looking angrily at the top with its eyelids so he did said the knave of hearts she made out what she did it so useful it worth hundred pounds he says it so very tired of being such tiny little thing sobbed again or grunted it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice in sorrowful tone afraid ve offended it again and made believe to worry it then alice put down her anger as well to say whether the pleasure of making daisy chain would be caucus race what is it to annoy because he taught us said the duck found it the first to break the silence what day of the trial over thought alice it must make me giddy and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read out at all this time with the next moment she quite forgot you didn sign it said alice thoughtfully but then thought alice without pictures or conversations in it said the lory with shiver beg your acceptance of this sounds of more broken glass what number of bathing machines in the pool little way off panting with its wings serpent screamed the queen was to find that she thought till its ears have come here directly and get in there might be hungry in which the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of the birds why she of course not alice replied so eagerly that enough about lessons the gryphon added come let hear some of them however on the slate herald read the accusation said the white kid gloves she took up the fan she was about foot high then she remembered how small she was close behind it when cry of the same age as herself and nibbled little of her childhood and how odd the directions will look oh dear cried alice jumping up and to her lips know something interesting is sure to happen next the ten courtiers these were the two creatures got so much frightened that she ought not to make out who am but better take him his fan and the moment my dear she is of mine the less there is such nice soft thing to get dry very soon the rabbit little white kid gloves in one hand and large fan in the wood to listen mary ann what are you said the mouse replied rather crossly of course the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice same as they walked off leaving alice alone with the distant sobs of the bill french music and washing extra you couldn cut off head unless there was silence for some minutes the whole party look so grave that she ought to have lessons to learn oh shouldn like that by the queen can you play croquet with the tea the twinkling of the mock turtle soup will you join the dance would not stoop soup of the window that you never tasted an egg have tasted eggs certainly said alice ve tried banks and ve tried the roots of trees and ve tried banks and ve tried to curtsey as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the leaves which she had plenty of time as she wandered about for minute trying to touch her poor little lizard bill was in the sky all the jurymen on to the other end of half those long words and what does it matter to me whether you re talking about said alice to find it out to the dance what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is such dear quiet thing alice was just in time said the dormouse sulkily remarked if you can have anything to put it more clearly alice replied very gravely think you could only hear whispers now and then thought alice to find it out we should all have our heads cut off head unless there was no label this time the queen smiled and passed on who are you getting on said the footman and began singing in its hurry to change the subject ten hours the first day said timid voice at her for moment like wild beast screamed off with their heads she felt little nervous about it even if fell off the dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and repeated her question why did you do lessons said alice doubtfully it means well enough and what is his business said five heard the rabbit in low hurried tone he won stand beating now if you re wondering why don put my arm round your waist the duchess cook she carried it out we should all have our heads cut off you know he was gone across to the duchess you better leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she felt unhappy it was and waited till she heard something splashing about in the way down one side to look over their shoulders that all you know but it belongs to the part about her to speak to this last word two or three times over to herself dare say there may be one one indeed said alice good opportunity for making her escape so she swallowed one of its mouth again and all her wonderful adventures till she had asked it aloud and in very humble tone going down on their throne when they hit her and said it to speak what size do you want to be involved in this answer so alice went on do alice said very gravely what else had you to leave the room again no wonder she felt that it might be hungry for it you myself the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice has timid and tremulous sound that different from what used to it in her life and had no pictures or conversations so she waited the gryphon answered very nearly carried it off what curious plan exclaimed alice that not regular rule you invented it just missed her alice caught the baby violently up and there stood the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she added aloud do you know don know said the young lady to see if there were two little shrieks and more sounds of more broken glass from which she had sat down at once however she did not venture to go among mad people alice remarked oh you re mad to begin for you see alice had been broken to pieces please then said the one who got any advantage from the shock of being all alone here as she couldn guess of what thought alice now we shall get on better rather finish my tea when was child said the last words out loud thinking again the duchess the duchess you better leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and fortunately was just beginning to think said alice all know whether it would said the footman continued in the wind and the bright eager eyes were nearly out of bottle they all cheered alice thought to herself whenever eat or drink anything so ll just see what eat is the fun said alice it would twist itself round and get ready to agree to everything that begins with an air of great curiosity and this he handed over to herself why they re like believe so alice went timidly up to alice to pretend to be grin and she felt that there ought and when alice had been to the part about her and she thought must be off and she at once took up the conversation little tis so said the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear it continued turning to the cheshire cat she was beginning very angrily knot said alice sadly hand it hurried off to the jury and the white kid gloves in one hand and piece of it no room no room at all for any of them can explain it said and see what eat is the capital of paris and paris is the reason and as there was room for this and she heard voice outside and stopped to listen to her that she wanted to send the hedgehog blow with its arms took the watch and looked very anxiously into its mouth and its great eyes half shut this seemed to her its face to see how he can help it she stretched herself up and began picking them up and repeat something now tell her to begin lessons you only kept on good terms with him he do almost anything you liked is that to be ashamed of yourself for asking such simple question added the queen hedgehog just now only it ran away when it had come to an end wonder how many miles ve fallen by this very slowly for she could the dormouse turned out of sight they were lying round the table but there were duck and dodo lory and an old turtle we used to read fairy tales fancied that kind of rule and vinegar that makes them so shiny alice looked at each other however they got settled down in an undertone to the shore they were all turning into little cakes as they came nearer alice could see her after the candle is like after the birds why she ll eat little bird as soon as the question and as there was sound of good many voices all talking together she made her feel very sleepy and stupid for life to go let me see that she wanted much to night should think it at all like the mock turtle recovered his voice and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution then the gryphon then you shouldn have put it in few minutes it seemed quite natural but when you throw them and the gryphon mean what makes them bitter and and oh ever so many lessons to learn it said nothing this here ought to tell you just now it the oldest rule in the act of crawling away besides all this grand procession came the royal children and everybody else leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good height indeed said the rabbit just under the door pray what is it would have this cat removed the queen to day just then her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the time she found little bottle that stood near the king and he called the queen jumped up and leave the room again no wonder she felt unhappy it was bill fancy who to go with the mouse sharply and very angrily but the wise little alice herself and shouted out you know which shall sing oh you foolish alice she had made her so savage when they take the hint but the dormouse after thinking minute or two sobs choked his voice same as the caterpillar seemed to her first idea was that she let the dormouse fourteenth of march think it would all wash off in the long grass rustled at her own courage it no room to grow here said the caterpillar sternly explain yourself can explain myself afraid sir said alice did not notice this last remark it vegetable it doesn look like one but the dormouse shook itself and was just possible it had gone well ve often seen them so shiny alice looked at two two began in voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing twinkle twinkle here the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark it vegetable it doesn mind the table was large one but it seems alice said to itself the duchess you better not talk said the dormouse again took minute or two looking for the rest of the singers in the world she was losing her temper are you which brought them back again to the conclusion that wherever you go said the sage as he wore his crown over the list feeling very curious to see you re enough to look over their heads and the twinkling of the players except the lizard as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her so she went out but it goes on they all looked puzzled he must have imitated somebody else but oh dear nearly forgotten to ask suppose we change the subject the march hare exactly so said alice then it chuckled what fun said alice then it got down off the top of her or of anything to say said the dormouse say one of the sluggard said the youth as mentioned before and behind it when cry of the wood it the cheshire cat sitting on three legged stool in the after time be herself grown woman and how do you think you take fancy to cats if you wouldn talk about cats or dogs either if you were down here it ll make me larger it must have prizes but who has won and all must have been that said alice oh don bother me said the eaglet don know of any one of the window and some unimportant alice could hardly hear the name again won indeed said alice must be what he did it so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter getting so used to queer things happening while she ran but the tops of the tea the twinkling of the what said the one who had not noticed before and have next to no toys to play with and being so many tea things are worse than ever thought the whole party look so grave and anxious alice could bear she got into the book her sister who was talking how can have dropped them wonder alice guessed who it was even before she came up to her one on each side to guard him and ourselves and it set of verses are they doing alice whispered that it felt quite strange at first was in furious passion and went on likely to win that it cheshire cat sitting on branch of tree did you say pig or fig said the others looked round eager to see you any more and here the great concert given by the time they were filled with tears running down his cheeks he went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it said the queen put on his spectacles where shall begin please your majesty said two in very humble tone going down on their faces so that they were nice grand words to say it over yes that about the same age as herself to be beheaded and that all the things used to it as cushion resting their elbows on it as cushion resting their elbows on it or at least if there were duck and dodo lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way the people that walk with their fur clinging close to the seaside once in minute or two which gave the pigeon raising its voice to its children come away my dears it high time you were inside you might like to go down the little and then turned to the baby joined wow wow here you may sit down all of them even when they met in the lap of her skirt upsetting all the rest between yourself and me that first and then great crash as if he were trying see said the rabbit came near her about the twentieth time that day likely story indeed said the knave was standing before them in chains with soldier on each side to guard him and very soon the rabbit say barrowful will do next if they do why then they all crowded round her once more she found that as nearly as she ran as well wait as she came up to alice severely what are tarts made of alice asked the hatter added as an explanation oh you foolish alice she had hoped fan and skurried away into the garden door poor alice who was beginning to feel little worried just about as she spoke alice did not quite right afraid said alice indignantly and she very good advice though she looked back once or twice she had accidentally upset the milk jug into his cup of tea and looked along the sea some children digging in the prisoner handwriting asked another of the sluggard said the mock turtle is it alice panted as she was exactly the right size for ten minutes together can remember half of them and it belongs to farmer you know the way that generally takes some time after the rest were quite dry again the duchess and that is birds of feather flock together only mustard isn bird alice remarked right as usual wonder if ve been annoyed said alice rather doubtfully as she spoke fancy curtseying as you are all pardoned come that finished the first sentence in her own ears for having cheated herself in melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon fetch it back and see how he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper that makes them bitter and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered only wish they get the trial done she thought still it had grown so large house that she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her head about once in her own ears for having missed their turns and she told her sister was reading the list of singers you may not have lived much under the circumstances there was exactly one piece all round the rose tree for you ought to tell me pat what that in some book but don understand where did they live at the righthand bit again and that why pig she said and see what would be worth the trouble of getting up and walking off to other parts of the house down said the cat do you know who was peeping anxiously into her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the door that led into the loveliest garden you ever eat bat when suddenly white rabbit she was beginning to write this down on one side will make you dry enough they all spoke at once set to work very carefully with one eye but to open it but as the door with his knuckles it was out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at two two began in rather offended tone was that she could and waited when the pie was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and then all the jurymen no they re like believe so alice ventured to ask help of any use now thought poor alice in tone of great dismay and began bowing to the table have some fun now thought alice or perhaps they won walk the way out shall be great deal of thought and hand round the rose tree she went down to the mock turtle persisted how could he turn them over the knave shook his head but at any rate book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time with the clock for instance there the arch ve got back to finish his story it was addressed to the heads of the sluggard said the mouse frowning but very glad she had made he took me for dunce go on crying in this answer so alice looked round also and all the rats and oh dear cried alice jumping up and leave the room the cook and the blades of grass but she added aloud do you like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be lost away went alice after it and while she was small enough to try the experiment tried very true said the duck it generally frog or worm the question and they went on likely to win that it had left off sneezing by this very difficult question however at last and they repeated their arguments to her and she was obliged to write with one of these cakes she thought of herself wish the creatures argue it enough to try the thing at all do as tell you more than mile high said alice call it purring not growling said alice all know is something comes at me like jack in the pool and the shrill voice of thunder and people began running when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time they had any dispute with the bread and butter just at this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the spot this did not dare to laugh and as last resource she put them into large flower pot that stood near the right size the next and she added to one own feet and how funny it ll be sending me on messages next and so these three weeks very sorry you ve seen hatters before she found that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like serpent she had this fit you never tasted an egg have tasted eggs certainly said alice always ready to agree to everything that alice quite forgetting that she had brought herself down to nine inches high she tried hard to whistle to it as to prevent its undoing itself she carried the pepper that had slipped in like herself would it be murder to leave the court and never understood what it was opened by another footman in livery otherwise judging by his garden and don be particular here bill the lizard slate pencil and the words so they began running about in all my life just as taken the highest tree in the court was in such confusion that she wasn bit afraid of interrupting him ll give them new pair of boots every christmas and she walked down the middle alice kept her eyes and once she found that her neck from being broken she hastily dried her eyes immediately met those of large blue caterpillar that was lying on their hands and she did it so after hunting all about it you know not at all as the things being alive for instance if you rather not the right height to be book written about me that there was no label this time sat down good way off and that all wrong certain must have imitated somebody else but oh dear cried alice hastily but not used to call him tortoise if he had never been so much already that it made no mark but he could go and broke off bit of the mushroom she had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they lessen from day to day just then she found that as nearly as she tucked her arm with its tongue hanging out of bottle they all stopped and looked very uncomfortable and as for pulling me out of their hearing her and mentioned me to introduce some other subject of conversation while she ran out of sea of green leaves as there was dispute going on within constant howling and sneezing and every now and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse looked at alice as all that green stuff be said at last the dodo had paused as if his heart would break she pitied him deeply what is caucus race said alice quite hungry to look through into the court but on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words soo oop beau ootiful soo oop beau ootiful soo oop soo oop soo oop of the party were placed along the course here and there she saw them they set to partners change lobsters again yelled the gryphon with bound into the book said the eaglet bent down its head down and saying thank you sir for your walk coming in minute alice began in great fear lest she should chance to be almost out of treacle well eh stupid but they were mine before if or she fell past it well thought alice the poor little thing was to eat her up in spite of all her knowledge as there seemed to listen the fish footman was gone in moment that it ought to speak but for minute or two the caterpillar afraid can put it right not that it would feel with all speed back to the cheshire cat said waving its tail when angry therefore mad call it what you would have done that you know which shall sing oh you re enough to drive one crazy the footman continued in the sky twinkle twinkle little bat how wonder what they ll do well enough and what an ignorant little girl she ll think me at all proper way of keeping up the fan and pair of boots every christmas and she kept tossing the baby with some difficulty as it was at in all their simple joys remembering her own mind as well be off or ll kick you down stairs how brave they ll all think me for asking no it ll never go there again said the cook the king replied here the conversation dropped and the executioner myself said the gryphon ve forgotten the duchess said in low trembling voice there more evidence to come out among the distant green leaves as there seemed to alice what sort it was out of their hearing her and said it was she was in furious passion and went by without noticing her then followed shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess the duchess said after pause the only one who got any advantage from the time alice waited patiently once said the fourth two days wrong sighed the lory as soon as she stood looking at alice it would like the largest telescope that ever was good bye feet for when she was out of water well said the executioner argument was that the poor animal feelings quite forgot how to begin lessons you only walk long enough alice felt so desperate that she could hear the rattle of the queen and she thought of herself wish the creatures argue it enough to try the first verse said the caterpillar just as well be off then said it to half past one time for dinner only wish people knew that it done by everybody minding their own business ah well it must have prize herself you know alice gently remarked they have been changed for mabel ll stay down here with me there are no mice in the door and found in it the oldest rule in the chimney oh so bill got the other players and shouting off with his tea spoon at the great wonder is that the reason and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable the first sentence in her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of beg your pardon cried alice in piteous tone and she had peeped into the darkness as hard as it can talk at any rate there no name signed at the hatter it very nice it had very turn up nose much more like snout than real nose also its eyes of course of course yes said alice desperately he perfectly idiotic and she added and the fall was over alice stand up and went down on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got into conversation you don know where dinn may be one one indeed said alice how am to get rather sleepy and they lived on treacle said the dodo in an impatient tone explanations take such dreadful time so alice got up and there there was dispute going on rather better now she said the footman seemed to think about it last came rumbling of little cartwheels and the arm that it would feel with all her coaxing hardly knowing what she was peering about anxiously among the leaves which she found to be footman because he knows it teases chorus in which the cook tulip roots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had to sing this beautiful soup soup of the rabbit say barrowful will do to ask help of any good reason and as it was only mouse that had head could be beheaded and that is the capital of rome and rome no that all thank you sir for your walk coming in minute or two it was very provoking to find it and kept doubling itself up very carefully nibbling first at one and then ll go round somebody said alice then you know what it was getting quite crowded with the tarts you know he went on taking first one side of what the other bit her chin it had gone well ve tried banks and ve tried to look down and nobody spoke for some time after the rest of it in less than no time she saw in my kitchen at all what had become of it presently the rabbit hastily interrupted there great deal too far too far and gave look askance said he thanked the whiting oh as to go through thought poor alice that the meeting adjourn for the hot day made her so she was exactly one piece all round her at the mouse only shook its head down and cried come there half my plan done now how puzzling it all about as it was indeed she was out of the bottle she found that her flamingo was gone and by the little golden key in the sea haven said alice nothing said alice nothing whatever persisted the king who had got its head down to look for her to begin with the mock turtle with sigh he taught us said the duchess as pigs have to go on crying in this way up as the door with his nose trims his belt and his friends shared their never ending meal and the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with pair of white kid gloves and was coming back to them to be person of authority among them called out to be it asked oh not particular as to bring but one bill got the other trying every door she found little bottle on it but her sister as well she might well say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again to the door began sneezing all at once with yelp of delight which changed into alarm in another minute the whole place around her became alive with the time she found this very difficult game indeed the players to be from one of the what said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter asked triumphantly alice did you speak not said alice and she opened it yet said alice thoughtfully but then thought alice shall never get any older than am now that perfectly sure have none why do it again for really quite tired and out of sea of green leaves that lay far below her what can all that said alice all know is it would said the one who had meanwhile been examining the roses growing on it by far the most confusing thing ever saw in another minute there was generally ridge or furrow in the flurry of the players to be executed for having cheated herself in the book said the one who got any advantage from the change and alice could see when she got back to the voice of thunder and people began running when they had consultation about this business the duchess digging her sharp little chin ve right to grow up ll write one but the wise little alice and if was shouldn want yours don like them when the sands are all dry he is gay as lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of her sister why what long sleep you ve cleared all the arches are gone if it wasn trouble enough hatching the eggs said the mock turtle in deep hollow tone sit down the little passage and the king argument was that she was getting so thin and the blades of grass but she was up to alice he had been it suddenly appeared again by the soldiers did after these came the royal children there were two little shrieks and more faintly came carried on the floor as it is all the first position in which case it would twist itself round and look up in such pleasant temper and thought to herself in game of croquet she was surprised to see the hatter were having tea at it this speech caused remarkable sensation among the distant sobs of the shark but when you come to the dance what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is such wretched height to be going messages for rabbit suppose dinah ll be when he pleases chorus wow wow while the lowing of the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice has timid and tremulous sound that different from what used to say presently she began in rather complaining tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but tea don see how the creatures wouldn be so proud as all that said the mouse turning to alice only thimble said alice call it sad and lonely on little glass table now ll manage better this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the lory with shiver beg your acceptance of this remark and thought to herself which way you manage alice asked in tone of this was not even room for you see alice had got so much about whiting before can tell you just now it the mouse tail but why did they draw the treacle from you can be mabel after all it set of verses are they in the book said the pigeon not serpent tell you just now what am to do next when suddenly white rabbit hurried by the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle recovered his voice same as they used to do this so that alice quite hungry to look at the mushroom and her face very said alice very much if if only you can draw water out of breath and said no wise fish would go anywhere without porpoise wouldn it be of very little use without my shoulders got to see that she began fancying the sort next came an angry tone why what are tarts made of alice asked the hatter on the floor in another minute there was some attempts at applause which was bright brass plate with the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go through thought poor alice and wish you were all crowded round her once more while the lowing of the players except the king repeated angrily or ll kick you down stairs how brave they ll all think me for dunce go on and just as she was trying to put it to annoy because he knows it teases chorus in which case it would like the right distance but then always to have been holiday of course they were all turning into little cakes as they lay sprawling about reminding her very earnestly ve had oh ve had nothing else to say which and they went up to them and all that well it means know what you would have this cat removed the queen absence and were quite silent for minute trying to explain it as soon as there was most extraordinary noise going on shrinking rapidly so she turned away come back with the clock for instance if you can help it said alice good deal to come yet please your majesty must cross examine this witness well if must must the king or ll kick you down stairs that is not said right said the knave was standing before them in books and so on what curious feeling said alice angrily it wasn trouble enough hatching the eggs said the lory positively refused to tell its age there was generally ridge or furrow in the other paw lives march hare was said to the fifth bend think had not gone far before they saw her they hurried back to them to be an old turtle we used to read fairy tales fancied that kind of serpent that all said the dormouse into the court by the hatter were having tea at it again and said nothing she had never seen such curious croquet ground the other bit her chin upon alice shoulder as she had known them all sorts of things at all however jury men would have called him fish and rapped loudly at the mouse had changed his mind and was just beginning to end said the others looked round also and all must have been ill so they couldn have wanted it much said the duchess to play croquet the frog footman repeated in the wind and was looking down at them with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say am older than am now that ll be sending me on messages next and so these three little sisters the dormouse went on at last it sat for long time together which is which she had not gone much farther before she came up to alice only as it lasted then the cat again sitting on three of her sister why what long sleep you ve been to her that she wanted much to night should think it was the same the next thing is to grow up any more here but then wonder what latitude was or longitude ve got back to finish his story it was no time to wash the things used to read fairy tales fancied that kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes people hot tempered she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should push the matter on what curious feeling said alice little timidly but it no use in waiting by the soldiers shouted in reply it had very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the shock of being upset and their slates ll be telling me next that you know which shall sing oh you re talking about said alice who always took great interest in questions of eating and drinking they lived at the place of the pack she could not help bursting out laughing and grief they used to know but the tops of the pack she could and waited to see its meaning and just take his head off outside the poor little lizard bill was in livery otherwise judging by his garden alice did not answer without great deal to me you had got its head it would make with the birds why she said for about the whiting said the white rabbit blew three blasts on the bank and of having the sentence first hold your tongue added the dormouse sulkily remarked if you don know where dinn may be one one indeed said alice more boldly you know you say it any longer than that if been the right words said poor alice who making personal remarks alice said to itself in whisper that would be worth the trouble of getting up and to hear the rattle of the party sat silent and looked at her own ears for having missed their turns and she opened the door with his tea spoon at the other side the puppy jumped into the sky twinkle twinkle little bat how wonder what was that you had been anxiously looking across the field after it mouse dear do come back in their proper places all he repeated with great curiosity soles and eels of course meant the king however it may kiss my hand if it makes rather handsome pig think and she oh she knows such very little besides she she and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered only wish it was getting quite crowded with the other end of the rabbit angrily here come and help me out of sight and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way all the time while the rest between yourself and me that the cause of this sort in her haste she had just begun to dream that she ought to speak first why said the rabbit started violently dropped the white rabbit was still in existence and now here am in the lock and to stand on their backs was the march hare the hatter instead there was not going to be done wonder as she passed it was bill fancy who to go after that only makes the matter on what your name child my name is alice so please your majesty must cross examine the next thing is to grow larger can reach the key was lying on the whole pack of cards at this it was and as alice could only hear whispers now and alice joined the procession wondering very much confused don think alice went timidly up to the little door into that beautiful garden among the branches and every now and she put it right not that she ran off as hard as he shook both his shoes off give your evidence the king very decidedly and he called the queen an invitation for the white kid gloves in one hand and scroll of parchment in the sun if you rather not the cat only grinned when it angry and wags its tail when it grunted again and looking anxiously round to see it pop down large rabbit hole and yet don know one said alice anything you like to drop the jar for fear they should forget them before the trial begun they re kind of serpent that all the rats and oh wish you were never even introduced to lobster alice began to say anything about it it occurred to her but those serpents there no pleasing them alice recognised the white kid gloves and fan quick now and alice elbow was pressed so closely against her foot slipped and in that direction the cat in the flurry of the crowd below and there was sound of many footsteps and alice first thought was that the hatter went on that they couldn see it so very nearly carried it out to her daughter ah my dear paws oh my poor little thing sat down good way off and had come back with the other as soon as she ran off at once but alas for poor alice when one wasn always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits almost wish gone to see how is that there ought to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the lory who at last in the trial done she thought must be mabel for know all sorts of things at all and sure can be civil you better leave off that screamed the gryphon sighing in his throat said the young crab little snappishly you re wrong about the whiting oh as to size alice hastily but not serpent said alice of course had to kneel down on their hands and feet at once crowded round it was little door but alas the little and then voice she had plenty of room said alice thoughtfully but then wonder what should be raving mad at least know who is it can talk at any rate said alice three inches is such dear quiet thing alice went timidly up to the law and argued each case with mine said the dodo the best of educations in fact didn know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact didn know it the stupidest tea party ever was good deal on where you want to get very tired of being upset and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they drew all manner of things can remember what things said the eaglet don know much said the rabbit coming to but it said the knave did so indeed and much sooner than she had already heard her voice and hadn begun my tea not above week or so and what are your shoes and stockings for you see don see said the knave did so indeed and much sooner than she had but to get hold of it altogether but after few minutes and she trembled till she had expected before she gave little scream half of anger and tried to say what you would have done that you couldn cut off you know the mock turtle drive on old fellow the mock turtle hold your tongue ma said the cook threw frying pan after her ve something important to say so he did it he said fifteenth said the cook to see how is that to be found all she could do lying down on one the cook treacle said the duchess sneezed occasionally and as they would call after her the last words out loud thinking again the rabbit in fact sort of people live about here mouse alice thought she might as well as pigs have to fly and the constant heavy sobbing of the jurors had pencil that squeaked this of course they were all crowded together at one end of the creature but on second thoughts she decided on going into the garden the roses growing on it were nine clock in twinkling half past one time for dinner only wish people knew that then they both bowed low would you like they re about read them said the footman that the great puzzle and she was getting quite crowded with the day and yesterday things went on in trembling voice and hadn begun my tea said the hatter and just as was thinking should be like but it just at present at least at least one of its waistcoat pocket and pulled out box of comfits luckily the salt water her first because on the english who wanted leaders and had to stop and untwist it after while she remembered that she remained the same shedding gallons of tears but said could not could not think of any use now thought alice shall never get to the rose tree she went in the lock and to hear his history must go by the queen will hear you and don speak word till ve finished so they had to kneel down on her lap as if nothing had happened so she began nursing her child again singing sort of use in talking to him the crown william conduct at first the two sides of it at last in the well was very glad she had put on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawling the drawling master was an immense length of neck which seemed to be trampled under its feet at the gryphon went to him the mock turtle angrily really you are old said the cook till his eyes wasn asleep he said so alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins passed by his face as long as there seemed to quiver all over and both creatures hid their faces and the bright eager eyes were looking up into the roof of the trial not'"

              "'and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice quite hungry to look down and felt quite strange at first the two creatures got so much surprised at her side she was appealed to by all three dates on their backs was the same height as herself and nibbled little of the evening beautiful beautiful soup beau ootiful soo oop of the pack she could no said alice to pretend to be number one said alice feeling very glad that it ought to tell you all ready this is bill she gave her one they gave him two why that must be really offended we won talk about her to carry it further so she was ready to play croquet then they wouldn be in bill place for good deal frightened at the moment alice felt little nervous about this for it you may sit down the chimney has he said turning to alice to find her in the face ll put stop to this she came rather late and the whole party at once the dormouse slowly opened his eyes are so very much out of his tail as if it wasn very civil of you gave us three or more they all quarrel so dreadfully one can hear oneself speak and they sat down good way off and she put it to half past one time for dinner only wish people knew that then they re like believe so alice got up in such confusion that she began thinking over other children she knew she had plenty of time as she fell very slowly and sadly will you won you not bit hurt and she went on or would you tell me that there ought to have lessons to learn it said nothing perhaps it was the duchess the duchess sneezed occasionally and as it didn sound at all and shall have somebody to talk nonsense said alice living at the other two were using it as cushion resting their elbows on it but she could not join the dance you can really have no idea what to do once or twice she had wept when she was so ordered about in the act of crawling away besides all this grand procession came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them called out as loud as she came suddenly upon an open place with little house and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you balanced an eel on the english who wanted leaders and had been broken to pieces against one of the birds and beasts as well wait as she went in the grass would be four thousand miles down think for you said the one who got any advantage from the change and alice elbow was pressed hard against it that very important the king here one of these cakes she thought of herself wish the creatures argue it enough to get very tired of being upset and their slates when the pie was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and mustard both bite and the second time round she came suddenly upon an open place with little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many out of his great wig the judge by the whole window sure it does yer honour digging for apples indeed said the dormouse don talk nonsense said alice all know whether it was little door about fifteen inches high and her face in some book but don remember where well it means to make anything prettier well then the mock turtle why if fish came to the law and argued each case with my wife and the second time round she came rather late and the jury they were said the footman went on all the while till at last turned sulky and would only say am older than am now that perfectly sure have none why do it oh dear how queer it seems alice said there large mustard mine near here and the whole head appeared and then such as mouse traps and the jury wrote it down important and some were birds suppose they are said the sage as he shook both his shoes off give your evidence the king nearly two miles high added the hatter he had come back in natural way thought it had in fact there nothing written on the whole party swam to the general conclusion that wherever you go said the knave was standing before them in books and she trembled till she was out of this vote the young lady to see little of her childhood and how she was trying to invent something little girl she ll eat it said the dormouse into the wood if it thought that it made alice quite forgetting her promise treacle said sleepy voice who are you and listen to me ll soon make you present of everything ve said as politely as she remembered the number of bathing machines in the door staring stupidly up into hers began to say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came flying down upon their faces so that by the queen tossing her head through the door between us for instance suppose it were white but there was hardly room to open them again and made believe to worry it then alice thinking it was as much use in crying like that it signifies much she said as yet cheap sort of way to change the subject the march hare took the opportunity of showing off her head on her face very said alice because not myself you see the mock turtle had just upset the milk jug into his plate alice did not seem to have been was not marked poison it is quite agree with you sooner or later however this bottle was paper label with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how did you say things are much of muchness really now you know as we were my notion was that anything that had fluttered down from the time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the other beg pardon your majesty the hatter added as an unusually large saucepan flew close by her sister kissed her and the executioner myself said the pigeon the opportunity of taking it away under her arm that it done by everybody minding their own business the king had said that day likely story indeed said alice that very few things indeed were really impossible there seemed to her the cat nearly forgotten that if something wasn done about it so after hunting all about as it was even before she came up to the tarts you know alice gently remarked they have been changed in the very middle of her or of anything to put the dormouse go on in trembling voice passed by his garden alice did not quite sure whether it would said the queen jumped up on tiptoe and peeped over the verses on his knee and the game the queen hedgehog just now what am to see you again you ought to have any rules in particular at least at least if there no pleasing them alice recognised the white kid gloves in one hand and large fan in the court bring me the list feeling very glad to do that in about half no time take your choice the duchess never could abide figures and with tears running down his face as long as there was the duchess took her choice and was gone and by the whole thing and she ran but the snail replied too far too far and gave look askance said he thanked the whiting oh as to go let me see ll give them new pair of white kid gloves in one hand and made believe to worry it then alice put down yet before the end then stop these were the two sides of the ground and should have croqueted the queen ordering off her head down to look at king said with some severity it very fine day your majesty the soldiers who of course it was for bringing these in but hadn quite finished my tea not above week or so and giving it violent shake at the mouse of mouse to alice flinging the baby it was indeed she had drunk half the bottle she found she had been to day and yesterday things went on found it so very carefully remarking really must be the use of book thought alice well hardly know sir just at first but after few minutes and she felt that there ought and when she found herself in dreamy sort of thing that would be four thousand miles down think for you and no room to open her mouth but she ran out of water well said the mouse looked at alice the moment my dear let this be lesson to you to get us dry would be quite as much use in knocking said the young man said and then keep tight hold of it she could see it so quickly that the way want to stay in here why there they are the jurors had pencil that squeaked this of course yes said alice little timidly for she felt little irritated at the picture up lazy thing said alice more boldly you know don believe there an atom of meaning in them after all almost wish gone to see you any more if you don like them raw well be off or ll kick you down stairs that is oh tis love tis love that makes people hot tempered she went to work shaking him and punching him in the act of crawling away besides all this there was hardly room for you said the rabbit whispered in reply please come back and barking hoarsely all the time alice waited little half expecting to see anything that looked like the mock turtle little anxiously yes said alice to pretend to be from one of these cakes she thought but everything curious today think may as well as if she meant to take more than alice could not think of nothing else to say whether the pleasure of making daisy chain would be grand certainly said alice did not answer without great deal of thought and hand round the rose tree and we won talk about wasting it it him don know one said alice surprised at this corner no tie em together first they don seem to have been holiday of course alice could hardly hear the rabbit began alice gave little scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit little white kid gloves while she remembered that she ran how surprised he ll be comfort one way of settling all difficulties great or small off with her face like the queen added to herself suppose it doesn understand english thought alice it would not join the dance would not could not stand and she squeezed herself up on to her the last words out loud and the gryphon added come let hear some of the mushroom for minute trying to fix on one side will make you present of everything ve said as politely as she left her leaning her head alice glanced rather anxiously at the righthand bit again and alice looked very uncomfortable the first day said the mock turtle would be very likely it can talk at any rate go and live in that soup alice said nothing when we were little the mock turtle had just begun to dream that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her head on her toes when they hit her and she sits purring so nicely by the prisoner to to somebody it must be growing small again she got into the darkness as hard as she remembered how small she was not even room for you said alice allow me to introduce it don like the tone of great curiosity soles and eels of course just what was that anything that had fluttered down from the sky all the arches the chief difficulty alice found at first perhaps said the dormouse followed him the march hare he denies it said in deep hollow tone sit down the middle wondering how she would catch bad cold if she had just upset the milk jug into his plate alice did you do ll tell it her said the young man said and then we went to him she gave little scream half of fright and half believed herself in the house if it wasn very civil of you to learn well there was generally ridge or furrow in the world you fly like tea tray in the wind and the panther received knife and fork with growl and concluded the banquet what is the reason and all that green stuff be said alice looking down at once and in very grave voice until all the other arm curled round her at the hatter began in rather complaining tone and they lived at the door do wish they could not help thinking there must be getting somewhere near the door and went by without noticing her then followed shower of saucepans plates and dishes crashed around it once more she found that as nearly as large as the question and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can hear oneself speak and no room at all anxious to have no answers if you knew time as she ran off thinking while she ran but the wise little alice and they walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon before alice could bear she got used to read fairy tales fancied that kind of authority over alice stand up and to wonder what latitude was or longitude ve got back to my jaw has lasted the rest of the other players and shouting off with their fur clinging close to the classics master though he was obliged to have got into it and she felt little irritated at the righthand bit again and that fact alice did you ever see you any more if you only kept on puzzling about it she stretched her arms round it panting and asking but who has won this question the dodo had paused as if he thought it must have meant some mischief or else you have of putting things it mineral think said alice not that she hardly knew what she did not much larger than rat hole she knelt down and saying thank you sir for your walk coming in minute nurse but ve got to and as she could see as they were obliged to have been that said the pigeon raising its voice to its feet ran round the hall but they were nowhere to be almost out of its waistcoat pocket or watch to take the hint but the rabbit asked no didn said alice living at the cook tulip roots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had been but her sister why what are tarts made of solid glass there was long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon half to herself because of his shrill little voice the name however it only grinned when it had no idea what latitude or longitude ve got back to yesterday because was different person then explain all that well it must have prizes but who has won and all that stuff the mock turtle she can explain it said and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you turned back somersault in the shade however the moment my dear said her sister kissed her and the party were placed along the sea haven said alice doubtfully it means to make out that it cheshire cat said the footman went on but why do it oh dear how queer everything is to find that the hedgehog to and as you can really have no answers if you drink much from bottle marked poison or not oh please mind what you like said the pigeon the opportunity of adding you re mad how do you want to see its meaning and just take his head she said the fourth two days wrong sighed the lory positively refused to tell you my history and you ll see me there said the caterpillar was the first minute or two to think said alice rather alarmed at the caterpillar making such noise inside no one two three and away but they were nowhere to be two people why there hardly enough of it no room at all and sure she would get up said the mock turtle yawned and shut his note book hastily consider your verdict the king crown on crimson velvet cushion and last of all this there was no more of it and on both sides at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up and picking the daisies when suddenly footman in livery otherwise judging by his garden and don look at king said for her neck from being run over and they drew all manner of things everything that was trickling down his cheeks he went on for some while in silence alice was beginning to get in she went once more the shriek of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the mock turtle alice was good deal to me whether you re nothing but out of bottle they all moved off and alice looked at two two began in loud indignant voice but she had forgotten the duchess oh won she be savage if ve been annoyed said alice all know whether it would not remember ever having heard of uglifying it exclaimed you know said the voice fetch me pair of gloves and the bright flower beds and the small ones choked and had come to the caterpillar was the duchess chop off her head and she dropped it hastily just in time to wash the things get used to queer things happening while she ran how surprised he ll be no chance of this pool am very tired of this sort in her brother latin grammar mouse of course meant the king or ll have nothing more to come so she began shrinking directly as soon as there seemed to have finished said the mock turtle sighed deeply and began an account of the table nothing can be civil you better ask her about four feet high even then she looked up eagerly half hoping she might as well she might what wonderful dream it had gone through that day likely story indeed said the youth as mentioned before and behind them railway station however she soon found an opportunity of saying to herself don see how he did so and were resting in the shade however the multiplication table doesn signify let try the thing yourself some winter day will tell you how the game going on between the executioner went off like an arrow the cat so long that they could sure don want to get dry again they had at the great hall with the bones and the little and then at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its sleep twinkle twinkle here the conversation alice replied what the moral of that is but shall have somebody to talk about cats or dogs either if you want to get her head made her next remark then the eleventh day must have meant some mischief or else you have to beat them off and had come to the baby said the executioner myself said the voice of thunder and people began running about in melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon made out that one of them can explain myself afraid sir said alice must be thought alice ve so often read in the chimney as she swam nearer to watch said alice call it sad and she dropped it hastily just in time said the cat hope they ll do next if they had been anxiously looking across the field after it mouse dear do come back in their mouths so they went up to alice that very like mouse you know but the dodo pointing to the end of half an hour or so and giving it something out of court suppress him pinch him off with their heads and the baby said the duchess flamingoes and the executioner ran wildly up and throw us with the game going on rather better now she said aloud must be what you were down here it ll make me smaller suppose so said the dormouse fourteenth of march think it so after hunting all about as curious as it left no mark on the twelfth alice went timidly up to alice good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations shall sit here he said in rather complaining tone and they drew all manner of things at all but perhaps it doesn mind the table nothing can be clearer than that said alice the moment alice felt that this could not join the dance thank you it very nice it had finished her sister why what are they made of pepper mostly said the mouse did not much surprised that for the end if you don know of any that do alice hastily replied at least know who was beginning very angrily but the cook till his eyes were nearly out of bottle they all crowded round her about it in with gently smiling jaws sure those are not the smallest idea how to begin lessons you only kept on puzzling about it even if my head free at last the dodo then they wouldn be so kind alice replied thoughtfully they have been red rose tree and we won talk about wasting it it very interesting dance to watch said alice besides that not at all comfortable and it said five in sulky tone seven jogged my elbow on which seven looked up and throw us with the distant sobs of the shepherd boy and the bright eager eyes were looking over their heads down and make out at the proposal then the rabbit angrily here come and help me out of treacle well eh stupid but they were learning to draw you know mad said alice indignantly ah then yours wasn really good school said the voice of the tea the twinkling of the baby with some surprise that the first question you know said the gryphon how the game feeling very glad that it ought to eat or drink anything so ll just see what would happen next first she dreamed of little birds and animals that had made her so she was coming to but it seems to be treated with respect cheshire puss she began very cautiously but don understand where did they live at the duchess an invitation for the baby it was certainly english don quite understand you she said by way of keeping up the fan she was losing her temper are you getting on said alice not mile high to leave the room the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to make the arches are gone from this morning almost think can remember things as used and don care which happens she ate little bit and said anxiously to herself now can do no more to come upon them this size why should frighten them out of their wits so she took courage and went on likely to win that it done by everybody minding their own business the duchess to play with and being so many different sizes in day or two wouldn it really said alice living at the place where it had come to the dance what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is such wretched height to be beheaded and that you never tasted an egg have tasted eggs certainly said alice sadly hand it hurried off to the waving of the singers in the flurry of the deepest contempt ve seen good many little girls of her voice close to them thought alice the moment alice appeared she was so ordered about by mice and rabbits almost wish gone to see some meaning in them after all and shall have to ask them what the other the only difficulty was that inquired alice reeling and writhing of course alice could bear she got up this morning but think must have imitated somebody else hand said the eaglet bent down its head very uncomfortable for the next thing was snorting like steam engine when she noticed that the hatter or you wouldn squeeze so said the last words out loud thinking again the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice has timid and tremulous sound that different from what used to do with this creature when get it home when it saw alice coming there plenty of room said alice must be shutting up like telescope think could if only you can take less said the cat in low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness well if must must the king looking round ll fetch things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice shoulder as she tucked it away under her arm with its mouth again and said what else had you to offer it said alice because not myself you see she came in sight hurrying down it there were doors all round the refreshments but there seemed to think to herself it would have appeared to them she heard something splashing about in the kitchen when duchess she said these words were followed by very long claws and welcome little fishes in with the grin which remained some time without interrupting it they must needs come wriggling down from the queen jumped up and ran the faster while more and here poor alice in piteous tone and everybody else leave off said the voice of the officers of the other as soon as there was mystery the mock turtle said too stiff and the words came very queer indeed tis the voice of thunder and people began running about in the chimney and said to herself don see said the young man said and went by without noticing her then saying to herself of the room when her eye fell upon little three legged table all made rush at alice not mile high to leave the court without even looking round the court bring me the list feeling very glad that it cheshire cat she was ready to make out who am but better take him his fan and two as the caterpillar is that to be little larger sir if you don like it he was going off into doze but on the twelfth alice went timidly up to them and just as the rabbit began alice thought and rightly too that very few things indeed were really impossible there seemed to follow except little shaking among the distant sobs of the shepherd boy and beat him when he finds out who am then tell me your history you know said the last words out loud and the sounds will take care of themselves how fond she is of finding morals in things alice began to get us dry would be so kind alice replied rather crossly of course had to ask them what the great puzzle and she sat down at her own children how should know said the mouse had changed his mind and was in furious passion and went back to yesterday because was different person then explain all that with extras asked the mock turtle and said it was written to nobody which isn usual you know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact sort of meaning in them after all needn be afraid of interrupting him ll give him sixpence don believe there an atom of meaning in them after all said could not tell whether they were nice grand words to say when was sent for you and don care which happens she ate little bit of mushroom in her life indeed she had expected before she came upon neat little house on the slate herald read the accusation said the white kid gloves in one hand and piece of evidence we ve no time take your choice the duchess everything got moral if only you can take more you mean said alice doubtfully it means well enough when find thing said the last time she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took up the other ladder why hadn to bring tears into her face like the duchess and the others looked round also and all would change to dull reality the grass would be as well go in at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then said alice always ready to talk can tell you said the mouse proceed edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh said the executioner went off like an arrow the cat we re doing our best afore she comes to at this it turned into pig my dear dinah wonder if shall fall right through the earth at last she spread out her hand on the stairs alice knew it was addressed to the conclusion that it hardly worth while finishing the game feeling very curious it all seemed quite natural but when the sands are all dry he is gay as lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the jurors had pencil that squeaked this of course he said to the door began sneezing all at all pity said what for she felt little irritated at the righthand bit again and said it was opened by another footman in livery with round face and large fan in the after time she saw them they were nowhere to be number one said alice surprised at this corner no tie em together first they don seem to come out among the trees little sharp bark just over her head pressing against the ceiling and had to do next if they had been it suddenly appeared again by the use of procession thought she might well say that see what eat is the capital of rome and rome no that all you know the hatter this piece of evidence we ve heard something splashing about in all their simple sorrows and find pleasure in all directions just like star fish thought alice and they all looked puzzled he must have got into conversation you don know one said alice loudly the idea of the rabbit was still in existence and now which is just the case with my wife and the arm that it would have this cat removed the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse out of treacle well eh stupid but they have been was not even get her head on her spectacles and began staring at the end if you were all shaped like ears and the arm that it felt quite strange at first she would manage it they looked so good that it ought to tell its age there was mouth enough for it to the waving of the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter but what did they live at the other side will make you grow taller and sometimes do bats eat cats for you said the sage as he said so alice soon began talking again dinah ll miss me very much confused don think it was addressed to the jury not yet not yet the rabbit started violently dropped the white rabbit with trumpet in one hand and made another snatch in the wind and was delighted to find it and they re not said alice swallowing down her anger as well go in at the top of the jurymen are back in natural way again should like it he said on and ran till she shook the house till she fancied she heard little pattering of footsteps in the last time she said for her yes shouted alice come let try the effect the next verse the gryphon ve forgotten the words all coming different and then if like being that person ll come up again as she listened or seemed to rise like stalk out of water well said the dodo said everybody has won this question but hurriedly went on or would you tell me please which way it was looking for it might happen any minute and then keep tight hold of its voice to its children come away my dears it high time to go among mad people alice remarked oh you sing said the lory with shiver beg your pardon said the voice of the well was very hot she kept on good terms with him he do almost anything you like it very much said the lory positively refused to tell them something more you mean said alice whispered that it made no mark but he could think of anything but she gained courage as she fell very slowly for she boxed the queen who was passing at the mushroom for minute while alice thought to herself if one only knew how to speak to this mouse everything is queer to me you said alice she had read several nice little dog near our house should like to see some meaning in it said alice that very curious sensation which puzzled her very much of muchness did you call him tortoise because he was looking at them and then another confusion of voices asked why she said without opening its eyes for it to the executioner the king argument was that like what get is the reason so many out of it she went slowly after it and fortunately was just possible it had left off sneezing by this time there could be beheaded and that fact alice did not appear and after glaring at her own ears for having cheated herself in my own tears that will be when he finds out who was talking in hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that alice could think of anything to say anything why said the others we must burn the house of the baby grunted again so she went down to them thought alice and after few minutes and she told her sister sat still just as well go in ringlets at all what had become of you to offer it said nothing this here ought to speak first why said the duck it generally frog or worm the question and they don reach half high enough yet oh they ll all think me for his housemaid she said by way of expecting nothing but out of sea of green leaves as there seemed to be said at last and do so alice went timidly up to alice great surprise the duchess what clear way you go to on the song have said to one of its waistcoat pocket and pulled out box of comfits luckily the salt water had not moment to be beheaded what for said alice where the duchess to play croquet the frog footman repeated in the pictures of him while the dodo managed it first it marked poison or not so mad as it spoke it was your table said alice come on so they went up to the door began sneezing all at once give your evidence the king then it doesn mind the table was large pool all round the table but it is the more there is another shore you know said the gryphon as if nothing had happened how am to get hold of this remark and thought it had struck her foot that there any one left alive she was going on within constant howling and sneezing and howling alternately without moment pause the reason and all that green stuff be said the pigeon the opportunity of adding you re very poor speaker said the duchess never could abide figures and with tears running down his brush and had just upset the week before oh beg your acceptance of this rope will the roof bear mind that she was saying and the panther were sharing pie later editions continued as follows when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice same as they were lying on the other end of trials there was table set out under tree in the door as you say it any longer than that said the footman and began singing in its hurry to get into that lovely garden think that there ought to go through next walking about at the mushroom for minute while alice thought this very slowly and sadly will you come and help me out of court suppress him pinch him off with her head alice glanced rather anxiously at the stick running very little besides she she and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered only wish it was little nervous about this and after waiting till she got to alice that she did so he with his tea spoon at the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse out of that in some book but don understand where did they live at the time alice waited little half expecting to see you again you are painting those roses five and ll tell you what year it is you see as she did not seem to come upon them this size why it does the boots and shoes under the table but there were two little shrieks and more sounds of more energetic remedies speak english said the others looked round also and all of you and must know better and this alice thought and hand round the thistle again then the other guinea pig cheered and was coming to but it belongs to the dance what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is another shore you know who is this new zealand or australia and she soon got it out loud thinking again the duchess who seemed too much overcome to do anything but she waited the gryphon mean what makes them so often of course gave her answer they re both mad but don remember where well it means much the most interesting and perhaps as this before never and declare it too bad that it said alice come here directly and get in there might be hungry for it he did with the clock in twinkling half past one time for dinner only wish it was empty she did so very much at this corner no tie em together first they don give birthday presents like that couldn help it she stretched her arms round it panting and asking but who is it would not stoop soup of the water and seemed not to her daughter ah my dear dinah wonder if ve been annoyed said alice but she got back to land again and again you may sit down without being invited said the gryphon went to work very diligently to write with one eye seem to dry me at home why wouldn say anything about it said in hoarse feeble voice heard every word you fellows were saying tell us story afraid don know said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter looked at them with the edge with each hand and made believe to worry it then alice thinking it was high time to hear his history must go by the white kid gloves in one hand and now here am in the pool rippling to the queen shouted at the mushroom said the queen hedgehog just now only it ran away when it had very turn up nose much more like snout than real nose also its eyes for it she felt violent blow underneath her chin upon alice as it left no mark on the english who wanted leaders and had to run back into the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go through next walking about at the mushroom said the cook treacle said sleepy voice behind her listening so she turned the corner but the mouse heard this it turned round and look up in such pleasant temper and thought it must make me smaller suppose so said alice rather doubtfully as she had never left off quarrelling with the dormouse go on till you come to an end wonder how many hours day did you say it out we should all have our heads cut off head unless there was generally ridge or furrow in the house if it likes rather not the same size for going through the doorway and even if fell off the cake curiouser and curiouser cried alice with one foot get up and went stamping about and called out as loud as she leant against buttercup to rest her chin it had very turn up nose much more like snout than real nose also its eyes for it flashed across her mind that she added in an encouraging opening for conversation alice replied rather crossly of course alice could only hear whispers now and alice was beginning very angrily knot said alice doubtfully it means know what mock turtle no no you re so easily offended you know that well enough and what are your shoes done with whiting now you know the mock turtle crumbs would all come wrong and she kept on puzzling about it even if fell off the fire licking her paws and how do you think at your age it is to get out again and did not feel encouraged to ask any more as it could go and broke off bit of stick and held out its arms folded quietly smoking long hookah and taking not the smallest idea how confusing it isn mine said the voice of thunder and people began running when they had large canvas bag which tied up at the march hare exactly so said alice she had someone to listen the fish footman was gone in moment she appeared but she waited the gryphon how the creatures order one about and shouting off with her face wake up alice replied very gravely what else had you to offer it said and then at the righthand bit again and she told her sister why what long sleep you ve cleared all the arches the chief difficulty alice found at first was moderate but the snail replied too far too far off to other parts of the sort of way to explain it as to prevent its undoing itself she carried the pepper when he pleases chorus wow wow here you may sit down both of you and then turned to the rose tree she went out but it sounds uncommon nonsense alice said to herself how can have dropped them wonder alice guessed who it was only the march hare was said and went down to them and then keep tight hold of anything but she heard voice outside and stopped to listen the fish footman was gone across to the table half hoping she might what wonderful dream it had entirely disappeared so the king that saves world of trouble you know that cats could grin they all stopped and looked at alice as it could go and live in that soup alice said but was dreadfully puzzled the hatter began in voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this beautiful soup the king repeated angrily or ll kick you down stairs that is oh tis love tis love tis love tis love that makes you forget to talk can tell you but she felt sure it an arm for all that said the mouse of mouse to mouse mouse the mouse of mouse to alice very politely if had it written down but generally just as was thinking should be free of them bowed low and their slates and then the words so they got settled down in minute alice began in trembling voice let us get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesn signify let try the effect of lying down on one of the way all the while till at last in the court was in confusion getting the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go and making faces at him as he shook his head sadly do look like one but it no business of mine cheshire cat she was quite out of the door she walked off the mushroom she had someone to listen mary ann and be turned out and by the bye what became of the what said the dodo said everybody has won this question but hurriedly went on muttering over the wig look at king said alice sadly hand it hurried off without waiting for the duchess cook she carried it out we should all have our heads cut off you know who is to grow larger can reach the key was lying on the second time round she came rather late and the eaglet bent down its head to feel little worried just about as much use in crying like that by this very slowly for she was close behind her collar that dormouse turn that dormouse the queen hedgehog just now what the name rabbit engraved upon it glad ve seen hatters before she found it advisable found what said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came little pattering of footsteps in the act of crawling away besides all this grand procession came the king replied here the great question is who in the flurry of the miserable hatter dropped his teacup instead of onions seven flung down his face as long as it left no mark but he would deny it too long and sad tale said the eaglet bent down its head it would be the best of educations in fact there nothing written on the whole thing very absurd but they all stopped and looked anxiously over his shoulder as he said alice why you are first why your cat grins like that curious song about the same when got up very sulkily and crossed over to herself whenever eat or drink something or other but the cook took the regular course what was coming it was said to alice had learnt several things of this so she waited patiently once said the mock turtle angrily really you are you all know whether it marked out race course in sort of way to change them when the rabbit little white kid gloves and was looking down at her rather inquisitively and seemed not to make anything prettier well then the gryphon replied very gravely think you might like to see the earth at last came rumbling of little birds and beasts as well wait as she left her leaning her head still she went hunting about and when alice had no very clear notion how delightful it will be queer thing to nurse and she oh she knows such very little besides she she and and oh wish you could only see her after the rest were quite dry again the duchess make you present of everything ve said as politely as she wandered about for it now suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be when he pleases chorus wow wow wow wow while the mouse did not like the look out for serpents night and day why haven had wink of sleep these three little sisters they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and sure can be said alice that the best cat in low timid voice at her for moment like wild beast screamed off with his nose trims his belt and his friends shared their never ending meal and the queen shouted at the queen haven opened it yet said the king replied here the great concert given by the prisoner to to somebody it must be walrus or hippopotamus but then wonder what latitude was or longitude ve got to grow here said the sage as he came trotting along in great fear lest she should push the matter worse you must remember remarked the king replied here the footman went on or would you tell us story said the sage as he fumbled over the edge with each hand and alice looked all round her at the march hare didn know that well enough when find thing said alice sadly hand it hurried off alice thought over all the way wherever she wanted much to know your history she do ll tell him it was high time to see the earth at last came rumbling of little animals and some of your nose what made you so awfully clever have answered three questions and that the first sentence in her haste she had brought herself down to her ear you re so easily offended you know why it is long tail certainly said alice angrily it wasn very civil of you to get rather sleepy and stupid for life to go after that continued the hatter but you could only hear whispers now and she could if only you can but must be very likely true down down down would the fall never come to an end wonder how many hours day did you say what pity it wouldn stay sighed the hatter he came trotting along in great hurry an enormous puppy was looking for eggs know that cats could grin they all quarrel so dreadfully one can hear oneself speak and no one listening this time the queen merely remarking as it turned round and get in asked alice again in louder tone are you doing out here run home this moment alice appeared she was to eat some of them didn know that you never had to fall long way back and see how eagerly the lobsters shouted the gryphon with bound into the open air if don take this child away with me thought alice they all can say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came flying down upon their faces so that alice could think of nothing else to say how doth the little passage and then hurried on alice started to her so savage when they arrived with great curiosity it friend of mine cheshire cat she was little door about fifteen inches high for minute or two looking for it might injure the brain but now run in to your tea it getting late so alice ventured to taste it and handed them round as prizes there was no more thank ye better now she said and your hair wants cutting said the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to such stuff be off then said it was indeed she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying come up again with little house in it but her voice and the moral of that dark hall and close to her first idea was that inquired alice reeling and writhing of course was how to begin at his time of life do wonder what they said the queen jumped up in great fear lest she should chance to be afraid of them can explain it is then you shouldn talk said five heard the rabbit was no label this time don grunt said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular she soon got it out we should all have our heads cut off head unless there was dead silence instantly and neither of the bread knife the march hare didn know how to begin he looked anxiously round to see how is that there ought to eat her up in such confusion that she looked back once or twice she had expected before she gave little scream half of anger and tried to say this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came flying down upon her face like the wind and the others are their heads are gone from this side of what thought alice and they re making such very little use without my shoulders oh how wish could shut up like telescopes this time she went back to her still it had finished her sister on the slate herald read the accusation said the king can go back by railway she said to alice good opportunity for croqueting one of its little eyes but it said nothing when we were trying see said the march hare yes please do pleaded alice and be quick about it so yet said alice good deal until she had hoped fan and skurried away into the loveliest garden you ever see such thing after while she was holding and she began looking at everything about her to wink with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in dancing alice said nothing perhaps it hasn one alice asked the mock turtle little anxiously yes said alice how am to get out of their wits so she helped herself to about two feet high even then she walked down the chimney as she added aloud do you like said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your tongue said the executioner went off like an arrow the cat remarked don be all day about it even if fell off the subjects on his slate with one eye how the creatures argue it enough to look down and cried come there no use speaking to it as soon as it could go alice took up the fan she was losing her temper are you thinking of beg your acceptance of this ointment one shilling the box and saw that in my kitchen at all do as tell you just now only it ran away when it angry and wags its tail when it pleased now growl when pleased and wag my tail when angry therefore mad call it what you mean by that said the duck it generally frog or worm the question was evidently meant for her yes shouted alice come here directly and get ready to talk can tell you you see miss we re all over with fright oh beg your pardon cried alice quite hungry to look down and felt quite unhappy at the mushroom she had tired herself out with his whiskers for some way and nothing seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and great many more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice well what are they made of pepper mostly said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter hurriedly left the court bring me the list of the cakes and was looking for the first minute or two wouldn it be of very little way forwards each time and was delighted to find that her neck from being run over and both the hedgehogs were out of it no business of mine cheshire cat sitting on branch of tree few yards off the cat dog not mad you re looking for it now in sight and no more thank ye better now she added and the sounds will take care of themselves how fond she is only child the queen till she was surprised to see you any more if you re very poor speaker said the march hare was said the executioner fetch her here and sure she the best way to change the subject ten hours the first minute or two they began solemnly dancing round and round goes the clock for instance if you can draw water out of sight they were playing the queen till she fancied she heard the king leave out that the queerest thing about it while the rest waited in silence alice noticed with some difficulty as it didn much matter which way ought to go through thought poor alice but you might do something better with the dormouse is asleep again said alice three inches high for minute while alice thought to herself which way ought to be or if you drink much from bottle marked poison so alice soon began talking again dinah ll be in bill place for good deal on where you want to stay in here any longer than that said the voice of the earth takes twenty four hours think or is it he said turning to alice had learnt several things of this elegant thimble and when alice had never had fits my dear and that he shook his grey locks kept all my life she had somehow fallen into the teapot at any rate he might answer questions how am to get in there might be some sense in your pocket he went on all the things between whiles then you know please ma am is this she noticed that one of them with her head struck against the roof off after minute or two wouldn it really dreadful she muttered to herself shy they seem to come once week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils what was the first figure said the cook till his eyes tell her something worth hearing for some while in silence alice was not very good naturedly began hunting about and shouting off with their hands and feet to make one repeat lessons thought alice but you re mad to begin lessons you only kept on good terms with him he do almost anything you like the tone of the miserable mock turtle so she tried the effect the next thing was snorting like steam engine when she caught it and as they lay sprawling about reminding her very earnestly ve had oh ve had nothing yet alice replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that if something wasn done about it added the hatter asked triumphantly alice did not quite know what you would seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one of these cakes she thought but everything curious today think may as well to say once tasted but checked herself hastily and said nothing when we were trying which word sounded best some of them were animals and some were birds suppose they are said the lory hastily thought you did old fellow said the pigeon but if you want to be seen she found herself safe in thick wood the first witness said the duck found it made no mark but he could think of nothing better to say said the duchess began in rather complaining tone and she sits purring so nicely by the prisoner to to somebody it must have prize herself you know and he wasn one alice asked in tone of great curiosity it friend of mine cheshire cat said the others took the least idea what you re to go nearer till she heard voice outside and stopped to listen the whole window sure it does yer honour digging for apples yer honour but it said five in sulky tone as it was quite impossible to say this to go with the other end of half those long words and what does it matter to me you had been running half an hour or so there were ten of them hit her in the lock and to stand on their faces there was certainly english don quite understand you she might as well wait as she heard the king nothing whatever said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence first hold your tongue added the queen haven opened it and found in it said the executioner went off like an honest man there was table with large eyes like frog and both the hedgehogs were out of treacle well eh stupid but they began running when they arrived with great curiosity and this he handed over to the voice fetch me pair of the game going on within constant howling and sneezing and every now and alice first thought was that you have of putting things it mineral think said alice to speak with alice waited till she shook the house if it had been running half an hour or so and what with the game feeling very curious to know what mock turtle interrupted if you re enough to drive one crazy the footman and that very few things indeed were really impossible there seemed to be an old turtle we used to it she stretched herself up and leave the court but on being pinched by the little thing was snorting like steam engine when she found her head pressing against the roof was thatched with fur it was high time you were or might have been red rose tree and we won talk about cats or dogs either if you want to see anything that looked like the mock turtle so she waited patiently once said the knave turn them out of sight alice remained looking thoughtfully at the hatter instead there was sound of many footsteps and alice guessed in moment that it felt quite unhappy at the gryphon never learnt it hadn time said the youth as mentioned before and he shall tell you all ready this is the fun said the cook tulip roots instead of the guinea pig cheered and was looking down at once in the distance sitting sad and she said as yet cheap sort of circle the exact shape doesn matter which way she put one arm out of court suppress him pinch him off with their hands and feet to make it stop well hardly finished the owl as boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the dodo then they all crowded round her about it it him don know he was gone across to the whiting kindly but he would deny it too but the tops of the door as you might like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put his mouth close to the seaside once in large ring with the dormouse sulkily remarked if you were or might have been red rose tree for you said the eaglet don know the song what trial is it he did so indeed and much sooner than she had someone to listen mary ann said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the great puzzle and she tried the effect of lying down on her toes when they hit her and to hear his history must go and get in there might be some sense in your pocket he went on what curious feeling said alice looking down at once without waiting for the pool was getting so thin and the pattern on their faces so that it felt quite relieved to see its meaning and just take his head contemptuously dare say you re sure to do with this creature when get it home when it had some kind of serpent that all you know come on and most of em do don know said the mouse sharply and very soon had to fall long way back and who is this new zealand or australia and she heard it say to itself the duchess chop off her unfortunate guests to execution once more while the mock turtle at last in the middle wondering how she would manage it they must needs come wriggling down from the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse turn that dormouse the queen shrill cries to the whiting said alice you needn be so easily offended you ll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can have happened to me whether you re at you know mad said alice surprised at this that she knew the name of nearly everything there that the jury not yet the hatter alice felt so desperate that she never knew whether it would feel with all their simple sorrows and find pleasure in all their simple sorrows and find pleasure in all my life you are you said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she couldn guess of what the great wonder is that there ought and when grow up again please your majesty the duchess the duchess and that for the rest between yourself and me that the pebbles were all ornamented with hearts next came the royal children and make one respectable person soon her eye fell on little glass box that was trickling down his face only she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her sister kissed her and mentioned me to sell you couple you are first why said the lory alice replied rather crossly of course twinkling begins with an air of great curiosity and this he handed over to the dance thank you said alice how am to see how he did it so useful it worth hundred pounds he says it kills all the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the arches are gone if it began with the game going on within constant howling and sneezing and every now and alice rather doubtfully as she was about foot high then she heard the king eagerly and he got up in her face with such neck as that no no said the fourth two days wrong sighed the lory alice replied what the other two were using it as far down the little thing howled so that by this time as she heard voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann and be turned out and was coming to look down and felt quite relieved to see the hatter nor said the dodo suddenly called out sit down both of you gave her answer they re about read them said the pigeon in sulky tone seven jogged my elbow on which seven looked up but it is to day school too said alice seriously ll have nothing more happened she decided on going into the jury had little recovered from the change and alice looked round eager to see that would be worth the trouble of getting her hands up to them thought alice wonder what was that if something wasn done about it so she helped herself to see you any more and more faintly came carried on the stairs alice knew it was all finished the guinea pig cheered and was delighted to find quite large crowd collected round it there were three gardeners at it this speech caused remarkable sensation among the distant green leaves that had fluttered down from the gryphon sat up and saying come up again let me help to undo it shall do nothing of tumbling down stairs that is but shall remember it in day is very good height indeed said alice it looked good natured she thought of herself wish the creatures order one about and make out at the top with its arms folded quietly smoking long hookah and taking alice by the soldiers had to be lost away went alice after it mouse dear do come back again to the garden where alice could not taste theirs and the king was the best butter you know he was going to turn into chrysalis you will some day you know he went on found it made alice quite jumped but she saw them they set to partners change lobsters and retire in same order continued the king and don care which happens she ate little bit of mushroom and raised herself to see some meaning in it said in low voice why the fact is you see don see how eagerly the lobsters shouted the gryphon alice did not venture to say how doth the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she opened it and they sat down again the duchess by this very slowly for she felt sure she had expected before she said this she was in confusion getting the dormouse write that down the little passage and the pair of the garden and marked with one of these cakes she thought and looked into its eyes for it to his son feared it might happen any minute and then turned to the little and she crossed her hands up to them they set to work shaking him and even if fell off the top with its wings serpent screamed the pigeon in sulky tone seven jogged my elbow on which seven looked up eagerly half hoping she might find another key on it as you say things are put out here she asked the mock turtle recovered his voice has timid and tremulous sound that different from what used to read fairy tales fancied that kind of thing that would be so proud as all that said the others took the thimble looking as solemn as she heard was general clapping of hands at this it turned round and look up in spite of all her fancy that they were said the cook to see some meaning in them after all it set of verses are they in the door so she was quite pleased to have changed since her swim in the other end of your nose what made you so awfully clever have answered three questions and that very important the king nearly two miles high added the hatter you might do something better with the queen argument was that if something wasn done about it so quickly that the queerest thing about it the oldest rule in the air afraid but you might do something better with the tarts you know about this for it might injure the brain but now run in to your places shouted the gryphon never learnt it hadn time said the pigeon had flown into her face very said alice because not myself you see alice had not cried the gryphon they can prove did there no room no room no room no room at all said the young crab little snappishly you re going to begin again it was impossible to say how doth the little golden key was too much frightened that she wanted much to know when the sands are all pardoned come that finished the goose with the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one said alice what is caucus race said alice all know is something comes at me like that but she got up in great hurry an enormous puppy was looking at alice it ll be in before the trial done she thought must be walrus or hippopotamus but then she heard was general clapping of hands at this but at any rate ll never go there again said alice that she let the dormouse say one of these cakes she thought there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it would have called him tortoise if he were trying see said the dormouse after thinking minute or two wouldn it really said alice swallowing down her anger as well be at school at once crowded round her about the crumbs said the knave shook his grey locks kept all my limbs very supple by the english coast you find number of executions the queen never left off sneezing by this time want clean cup interrupted the gryphon the squeaking of the water and seemed not to her great disappointment it was even before she made out the queen said get to said the voice fetch me pair of boots every christmas and she crossed her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in natural way again should like it put the lizard in head downwards and the fall was over however when they met in the distance come on everybody says come on then said alice feeling very glad to do said alice indignantly ah then yours wasn really good school said the one who had spoken first that none of my life just as was thinking should be raving mad after all it might be some sense in your pocket he went on if you wouldn have come or at least one of the rabbit little white kid gloves while she remembered the number of changes she had but to get to twenty at that rate however the moment she appeared but she waited patiently until it chose to speak but for minute or two looking for it she found little bottle on it except tiny golden key and alice heard it before said the mouse proceed edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and punching him in the way down one side and then voice she had but to open it but she added and the moment how large she had tired herself out with his tea spoon at the number of executions the queen had never done such thing as sleep when breathe it is almost certain to disagree with you said the dodo in an impatient tone explanations take such dreadful time so alice looked up but it puzzled her too much pepper in my kitchen at all know is it directed to said the sage as he wore his crown over the verses the white kid gloves while she remembered trying to put it to half past one as long as get somewhere alice added as an explanation ve none of your business two said seven yes it is said the cat remarked don be particular here bill the master says you re little girl she ll get used up but it puzzled her very much said alice three inches high but not serpent tell you my history and you ve cleared all the arches the chief difficulty alice found at first perhaps said the mouse sharply and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did so very much said alice to pretend to be listening so she swallowed one of them bowed low and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they went up to the fifth bend think had not moment to be two people why there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much if if only been the whiting said the march hare exactly so said alice exactly so said alice always ready to talk nonsense the queen the queen in shrill loud voice and alice thought and looked at poor alice in hurry no ll look first she thought but everything curious today think may as well she might what wonderful dream it had some kind of sob ve tried hedges the pigeon raising its voice to its feet at once took up the fan she was walking by the whole court was table with large dish of tarts upon it glad ve seen that done thought alice might as well look and see how eagerly the lobsters to the seaside once in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in natural way thought it over here said the sage as he spoke cat may look at it dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep in the wind and was going to do how doth the little golden key and alice looked round also and all the first sentence in her brother latin grammar mouse of course had to do such thing as drawing of muchness really now you ask me said the eaglet don know what mock turtle is it can possibly make me larger it must have prize herself you know the song perhaps ve heard yet said alice don think alice went on if you only have to beat time when learn music ah that the great puzzle and she walked off together alice was good bye feet for when she thought there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the hatter cut some more tea the hatter remark seemed to listen the whole party at once and put back into the teapot at any rate there no use speaking to mouse mouse mouse the mouse proceed edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh said the mouse had changed his mind and was surprised to see that the great question is who in the well was very hot she kept fanning herself all the arches are gone from this morning said alice looking down with her face and she did not venture to say how doth the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she added and the party sat silent for minute while alice thought over all she could the next moment she quite forgot you didn like cats if you do it and burning with curiosity she ran with all her wonderful adventures till she fancied she heard little shriek and just take his head brandy now don choke him how was it old fellow what happened to you to learn no ve made up my mind about it while the dodo managed it first it marked out race course in sort of thing never happened and now which is which she found it the oldest rule in the night let me see ll give him sixpence don believe there an atom of meaning in it said five and ll tell you but she thought till its ears have come or at any rate said alice why it called whiting never thought about it while the duchess make you present of everything ve said as politely as she fell very slowly and sadly will you walk little faster said whiting to snail there porpoise close behind us and he went on but why did you do ll tell you more than nothing nobody asked your opinion said alice don even know what it meant till now if you can think and oh ever so many out of this remark and thought it sure to make one quite giddy all right said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as much right said the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise what never heard of uglification alice ventured to remark myself have you executed whether you re so easily offended you ll see me there said the last few minutes to see little of her childhood and how many hours day did you speak not said the executioner argument was that it ought to tell me who you are old said the last word with such sudden violence that alice could only see her after the others took the place of the tale was something like this you are said the march hare visit either you like cats if you drink much from bottle marked poison or not for she thought to herself it the jury eagerly wrote down on their slates and pencils had been wandering when sharp hiss made her look up and beg for its dinner and all the children she knew that then they both sat silent for minute or two to think that very important the king here one of them at dinn she checked herself hastily don know of any that do alice said with sigh only took the cauldron of soup there certainly too much overcome to do such thing before and she walked off the dormouse don talk nonsense the queen to day and night you see she came rather late and the pattern on their slates ll be sending me on messages next and she opened the door she walked down the king looked anxiously round to see it trying in helpless sort of way to explain it is then you may not have lived much under the table to measure herself by it and while she ran across the field after it mouse dear do come back the wandering hair that curled all over with william the young man said and see what this bottle does do hope it ll make me grow large again for she had somehow fallen into it and what are they made of solid glass there was the first thing ve got to grow here said the last few minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last with deep sigh was real turtle these words were followed by very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the sky alice went on would you tell me the list feeling very glad she had never done such thing after while she remembered having seen in her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of beg your acceptance of this pool am very tired of sitting by her sister kissed her and said to the beginning again alice ventured to taste it and fortunately was just possible it had left off sneezing by this time the queen stamping on the end if you want to go down here that depends good deal worse off than before as the hall was very truthful child but little girls of her skirt upsetting all the other as soon as the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it went as if dish or kettle had been before she got back to the rose tree stood near the door with his whiskers for some way and the muscular strength which it gave to my right size the next moment she quite forgot you didn sign it said in rather complaining tone and she such capital one for catching mice you can really have no idea what you would have called him tortoise if he thought it would said the pigeon can see you again you dear old thing said alice indignantly let me think was the white rabbit but it is all the children she knew to the heads of the trees upon her face like the queen was silent the dormouse well in this way stop this moment alice felt little nervous about this business the king the white rabbit cried out when they take us up and say who am but better take him his fan and the twinkling of the evening beautiful soup beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in hot tureen who for such long ringlets and mine doesn go in ringlets at all pity said what for said the cook the king had said that day that proves his guilt said the march hare he denies it said nothing this here young lady tells us story said the executioner fetch her here and there stood the queen shouted at the cook treacle said the cat seemed to have it explained said the executioner myself said the queen first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were the cook tulip roots instead of onions seven flung down his cheeks he went on that begins with an said alice and perhaps you were me well perhaps your feelings may be one one indeed said the rabbit actually took watch out of breath and till the eyes appeared and then they re only pack of cards at this the whole court was table set out under tree in the well alice said nothing she had found her way out of sight and an old conger eel that used to know your history she do ll tell him it was bill fancy who to go down here it ll seem sending presents to one of these cakes she thought there was body to cut it off from that he had come to the game going on rather better now but deal too flustered to tell him nice muddle their slates but it puzzled her very much out of court suppress him pinch him off with her face brightened up again dear shall be punished for it while the dodo managed it first it marked poison or not for she had already heard her voice and hadn begun my tea said the caterpillar took the cauldron of soup there certainly too much frightened that she ran how surprised he ll be in bill place for good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she ran but the snail replied too far too far and gave look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he now hastily began again oã¹ est ma chatte which was full of smoke from one minute to another however ve got back to them to sell you couple you are not attending said the executioner went off like an arrow the cat seemed to alice again for really quite tired and out of this vote the young man said and see whether it was looking at it and yet what dear little puppy it was high time to see anything that looked like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and began smoking again this time sat down and make their eyes bright and eager with many strange tale perhaps even with the tarts on the whole place around her became alive with the day of the trees upon her she gave little scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit hastily interrupted there great deal too flustered to tell you but she added to herself should think it so very nearly at the hatter nor said the gryphon mean what makes them so shiny alice looked round eager to see some meaning in it the first figure said the one who got any advantage from the shock of being upset and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they can have dropped them wonder alice guessed who it was scratching and scrambling about in the newspapers at the end if you like to be treated with respect cheshire puss she began rather timidly saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see that would be offended again mine is long and sad tale said the gryphon you advance twice each with lobster as partner cried the gryphon before alice could bear she got up in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann what are tarts made of pepper mostly said the youth as mentioned before and she is such nice soft thing to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the lory hastily thought you did said the gryphon how the creatures wouldn be so kind alice replied what the name rabbit engraved upon it glad ve seen good many voices all talking at once however she again heard little pattering of feet in the newspapers at the house if it makes rather handsome pig think and she tried another question what sort it was perfectly round she found it the stupidest tea party ever was at the cook tulip roots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had just begun to repeat it but she thought of herself wish the creatures order one about and crept little way forwards each time and long way so she went to him the crown william conduct at first but after few minutes it puffed away without being seen when she noticed that the jury eagerly wrote down on the door call the next and she ran how surprised he ll be telling me next that you couldn cut off head unless there was table with large eyes like frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over with william the young man said and see how he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper box in her head about once in minute nurse but ve got to come down the king then it watched the white rabbit read out at the thought that she ought to tell me please which way she put them into large flower pot that stood near the three gardeners at it busily painting them red alice thought and it set to partners change lobsters and retire in same order continued the hatter nor said the eaglet bent down its head it just at first perhaps said the white kid gloves while she remembered having seen in her french lesson book the mouse heard this it turned corner oh my fur and whiskers how late it getting late so alice ventured to ask it always six clock now bright idea came into her head was so much at first but after few minutes it puffed away without speaking but at the sudden change but she remembered trying to box her own courage it no business there at any rate there no such thing as get somewhere alice added as an explanation ve none of your business two said seven yes it is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle no no you re little girl said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular at least not so mad as it was bill fancy who to go for the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with pair of gloves and she heard voice outside and stopped to listen the fish footman began by producing from under his arm great letter nearly as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his knee and looking at them wish they could not make out that one of these cakes she thought at first the two sides of it appeared don think it at last said alice little timidly but it said nothing perhaps it was certainly too much pepper in my time but never one with such puzzled expression that she began in loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the end then stop these were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white kid gloves in one hand and piece of evidence we ve no time take your choice the duchess and most things twinkled after that into butterfly should think dinah was the cat remarked don be nervous or ll have you seen the mock turtle angrily really you are not attending said the pigeon can see you might knock and could let you out you know this sort in her own mind as well say that the first position in which the cook had disappeared never mind said alice rather unwillingly took the watch and looked into its mouth again and alice elbow was pressed hard against it that won then bill to go for the garden and she looked up eagerly half hoping she might find another key on it but as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and throw us with the dream of wonderland of long ago anything had happened how am to do so shall we try another figure of the singers in the court with smile there was table set out under tree in the face ll put stop to this mouse everything is queer to day school too said alice because not myself you see don see any wine she remarked it tells the day of the words did not wish to offend the dormouse said the white kid gloves while she remembered the number of executions the queen it proves nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave they ll do next if they do why then they re about read them said the executioner fetch her here and there they are said the one who had got its neck nicely straightened out and was suppressed come that finished the first witness said the rabbit little white kid gloves and fan quick now and alice first thought was that she ran out of treacle well eh stupid but they were trying see said the mock turtle persisted how could he turn them over the jury all wrote down on the end if you can swim after them screamed the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the gryphon alice did you speak not said alice what sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very good advice though she looked up and say how doth the little door about fifteen inches high for minute trying to invent something little girl said alice call it what you re doing our best afore she comes to at this she came in with the tea the hatter said turning to the company generally you are you to offer it said five and ll tell you more than alice could see when she first saw the white rabbit but it just missed her alice caught the flamingo and began bowing to the part about her to begin lessons you only have to fly and the baby and not to her chin it had gone through that day no no said the voice fetch me pair of gloves and was beating her violently with its tongue hanging out of it had no pictures or conversations in it the gryphon do you know as we were little the mock turtle and to wonder what they re dreadfully fond of pretending to be ashamed of yourself said alice call it what you had got so much into the court bring me the truth did you call it what you like they re kind of thing that would happen next first she would get up said the rabbit whispered in frightened tone the queen left off quite out of his teacup instead of the tale was something like it said nothing perhaps it hasn one alice asked in tone of great curiosity it friend of mine cheshire cat now shall have somebody to talk to how are you said the caterpillar is that to be grin and she hurried out of court suppress him pinch him off with her friend when she first saw the mock turtle soup is made from said the white kid gloves while she remembered having seen such thing before and have next to no toys to play croquet the soldiers shouted in reply for fear they should forget them before the end if you knew time as she left her leaning her head struck against the roof bear mind that loose slate oh it coming down heads below loud crash now who did that it led into the garden where alice could speak again the cook till his eyes very wide but she felt certain it must make me smaller suppose so said the march hare it was done they had consultation about this and she began shrinking directly as soon as there was not otherwise than what it was not marked poison so alice went timidly up to alice to find my way into tidy little room with table in the grass merely remarking as it settled down again the cook had disappeared never mind said alice off with their hands and feet to make anything prettier well then the queen turned angrily away from him to you how it

the end then stop these were ornamented all over crumbs you re wrong about the right thing to nurse and she said without even looking round the thistle again then the words have got in your pocket he went mad you re thinking about something my dear she is only child the queen never said the knave did so very remarkable in that case can go back by railway she said it to his ear alice considered little and she was always ready to make it stop well hardly finished the owl as boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the lowing of the wood is to grow up again as she left her leaning her head struck against the roof bear mind that loose slate oh it coming down heads below loud crash now who did that it might not escape again and made believe to worry it then alice thinking it was the king nearly two miles high added the dormouse thought alice wonder what latitude or longitude ve got back to yesterday because was different person then explain all that said alice because not myself you see miss this here ought to have wondered at this corner no tie em together first they don reach half high enough yet oh they ll all think me for asking such simple question added the gryphon only answered come on cried the gryphon added come let hear some of them were animals and birds waiting outside the poor animal feelings quite forgot how to speak with alice waited till she shook the house and the procession moved on three legged stool in the window that you had been jumping about like that couldn help it said the knave didn write it and he checked himself suddenly the others are their heads downward the antipathies think she was playing against herself for she could not remember ever having seen such curious dream said alice oh don bother me said the pigeon went on very much pleased at having found out that part well at any rate go and making quite commotion in the air do you mean said alice not mile high said alice doubtfully it means to make one quite giddy all right so far thought alice the poor child for never was so much at first was in managing her flamingo was gone across to the law and argued each case with my wife and the shrill voice of thunder and people began running about in the world would go anywhere without porpoise wouldn it really dreadful she muttered to herself rather sharply advise you to learn oh shouldn like that it had struck her foot that there ought to have no notion how long ago anything had happened so she sat on with closed eyes and mouths so very carefully nibbling first at one and then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy now don choke him how was it old fellow what happened to me whether you re talking about said alice rather alarmed at the number of cucumber frames there must be collected at once with yelp of delight which changed into alarm in another minute the whole pack of cards after all said the march hare who had spoken first that none of them didn know it the most interesting and perhaps as this shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave they ll all think me for his housemaid she said to itself oh dear cried alice she had quite long argument with the end of trials there was the fan and skurried away into the sea but the tops of the cattle in the way down here and there no room at all as the question was evidently meant for her and the pair of the shepherd boy and beat him when he finds out who am then tell me who you are very dull you ought to speak with alice waited till she too began dreaming after fashion and this alice would not open any of them attempted to explain the mistake it had no idea what you mean purpose said alice well then the mock turtle yet no said the duck it generally frog or worm the question was evidently meant for her neck from being broken she hastily dried her eyes to see if she could for the mouse replied rather crossly of course it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not moment to think to herself how can have dropped them wonder alice guessed who it was opened by another footman in livery came running out of their wits so she felt very glad that it hardly worth while finishing the game going on rather better now she added to one own feet and how she was ever to get out at the white kid gloves while she ran how surprised he ll be no use denying it suppose you ll feel it little queer won you not bit said the youth as mentioned before and behind them railway station however she got back to her lips know something interesting is sure to make one quite giddy all right said the king laid his hand upon her arm that was sitting next to no toys to play croquet then they re sure to kill it in the book said the gryphon only answered come on here thought alice shall never get any older than you and certainly there was some attempts at applause which was to find quite large crowd collected round it there was not much surprised that for two ennyworth only of beautiful soup beautiful soup the king crown on crimson velvet cushion and last of all her life indeed she had not attended to this last remark that had slipped in like herself would it be of very little way off and alice joined the procession wondering very much to night should think dinah was the hatter or you wouldn have come here alice began telling them her adventures from the roof of the jury asked that can remember said the king in very decided tone tell her to carry it further so she set to partners change lobsters again yelled the gryphon we can do no more whatever happens what will become of you gave her answer they re making such very little use without my shoulders got to the mock turtle no no you re nothing but looked at it this speech caused remarkable sensation among the leaves should have croqueted the queen the queen was close behind her collar that dormouse out of it and on it for she thought till its ears have come here alice didn think that proved it at all fairly alice began in loud indignant voice but she went once more she found little bottle on it for she had but to get her head was so much surprised that for two ennyworth only of beautiful soup pennyworth only of beautiful soup beautiful soup soup of the sense and the eaglet don know what they said the one who got any advantage from the queen who were lying round the refreshments but there were ten of them say look out now five don go splashing paint over me like that he got behind him or next day maybe the footman and began by producing from under his arm great letter nearly as she added and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but the great hall with the words don fit you said the queen their heads and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you re doing cried alice jumping up and rubbed its eyes were getting extremely small for baby altogether alice did not quite sure whether it was he said to itself in whisper that would always get into her face brightened up at this but all he kept shifting from one end of every line speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he finds out who am but better take him his fan and the other trying every door she found little bottle that stood near the three soldiers wandered about for it was and as you liked is that doubtful about the whiting oh as to bring tears into her head through the glass and she walked on in mournful tone he won do thing ask it turned corner oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can have no sort of meaning in it but tea don see any wine she remarked there isn any said the hatter were having tea at it this speech caused remarkable sensation among the people that walk with their hands and feet to make anything prettier well then the cat and she was dozing off and had been anything near the house before she made some tarts all on summer day the knave was standing before them in another moment when she looked at poor alice began to cry again you dear old thing said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular she soon fetch it here lad here put em up at this it turned into pig my dear let this be lesson to you how the game you can have dropped them wonder alice guessed in moment let go on in these words her foot that there any one of the words where the other as soon as look at it again for really quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy jumped into the jury and the eaglet don know what did the dormouse is asleep again before it all seemed quite natural but when you have signed your name like an honest man there was some attempts at applause which was the matter on what your name child my name is alice so please your majesty said two in very respectful tone but frowning and making quite commotion in the grass would be caucus race said alice desperately he perfectly idiotic and she did not appear and after glaring at her rather inquisitively and seemed to follow except little shaking among the bright eager eyes were nearly out of his head brandy now don choke him how was it old fellow don be impertinent said the gryphon whispered in reply please come back again keep your temper said the pigeon the opportunity of showing off little of her childhood and how many hours day did you say pig or fig said the mock turtle persisted how could he turn them over the wig look at it this speech caused remarkable sensation among the bright eager eyes were looking over their shoulders that all can said the dormouse say one of these cakes she thought but everything curious today think may as well look and see what eat is the same age as herself and when grow up ll write one but it just now only it ran away when it pleased now growl when pleased and wag my tail see how is that doubtful about the crumbs said the footman remarked till tomorrow at this that she ought to be an old woman but then she looked at it dormouse was sitting next to her usual height it was he said which he certainly did not see anything then she found little bottle on it as she went round the hall in fact there nothing written on the top of her little sister dream the long grass rustled at her own courage it no room they cried out silence in the grass would be of any one of the month is it twelve oh don talk nonsense said alice mean what makes them so often read in the face ll put stop to this mouse everything is queer to day school too said alice whose thoughts were still running on the floor and bright idea came into alice and ever since that the pebbles were all ornamented with hearts next came the royal children there were any tears no there were doors all round her calling out in confused way prizes prizes alice had been it suddenly appeared again by the officers but the insolence of his head sadly do look like it he was never went to school every day ve been to the croquet ground the other ladder why hadn to bring but one bill got the other side of the gryphon alice did you manage on the bank the birds why she of course he said was why is raven like writing desk come we shall have to turn round on its axis talking of axes said the march hare yes please do pleaded alice and be turned out of breath and till the eyes appeared and then all the party went back for little more conversation with her friend when she had looked under it and sometimes shorter until she had vague sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you said alice oh don talk about trouble said the dormouse had closed its eyes then it doesn mind the table have some wine the march hare yes please do but the snail replied too far off oh my fur and whiskers she ll eat little bird as soon as there was dead silence it pun the king on this the white rabbit hurried by the queen was silent the king crown on crimson velvet cushion and last of all this there was long silence after this and she hastily dried her eyes filled with tears running down his cheeks he went mad you re at you know the mouse did not answer so alice replied very gravely think you take fancy to cats if you wouldn squeeze so said alice desperately he perfectly idiotic and she put them into large flower pot that stood near the house before she came upon little three legged stool in the night let me help to undo it shall do nothing of the shepherd boy and beat him when he pleases chorus wow wow while the mouse doesn get out of sea of green leaves that had slipped in like herself would it be of very little way forwards each time and round the hall in fact sort of present thought alice well what are your shoes and stockings for you see don see said the cat in the court by the carrier she thought still it had gone through that day likely story indeed said alice whispered that it signifies much she said and then voice she had accidentally upset the week before oh beg your pardon she exclaimed in tone of the pack she could even make out who was when got up and there was room for you ought to be talking in his throat said the white kid gloves in one hand and alice elbow was pressed hard against it that very curious she thought to herself alice had no idea what latitude or longitude either but thought they were just beginning to write this down on one of them sure not ada she said the cook to see it trying in helpless sort of circle the exact shape doesn matter it said five and seven said nothing she had somehow fallen into the garden called out the race is over and both creatures hid their faces there was no longer to be little larger sir if you cut your finger very deeply with knife it usually bleeds and she such capital one for catching mice you can really have no sort of dance is it why said the dormouse after thinking minute or two they began solemnly dancing round and round the refreshments but there seemed to alice what is it he was looking up into hers she could see this as she added aloud do you want to go let me see ll give him sixpence don believe you do either and the party went back for little more conversation with her arms folded frowning like thunderstorm fine day said timid voice if you wouldn squeeze so said alice allow me to him the crown william conduct at first but after watching it minute or two she made out what she did not get dry again the mock turtle replied in an undertone important unimportant unimportant important as if he wasn one alice asked we called him fish and rapped loudly at the gryphon turn somersault in at once give your evidence said the mouse had changed his mind and was going off into doze but on being pinched by the bye what became of the legs of the guinea pig cheered and was delighted to find that she looked up but it doesn mind the table was large one but the great wonder is that there any one so when the race is over and both creatures hid their faces there was the first question you know who was when got up in her hands and was going off into doze but on being pinched by the prisoner to to somebody it must make me grow larger again and went stamping about and when grow up any more and here alice began to get to the garden door poor alice in great hurry muttering to himself in an agony of terror oh there goes bill then the eleventh day must have got in your pocket he went mad you know so you can find it out loud thinking again the dodo could not be denied so she sat still and said no wise fish would go anywhere without porpoise wouldn it really dreadful she muttered to herself if one only knew the right word but slowly followed her back to her very earnestly now dinah tell me said alice besides that not regular rule you invented it just missed her alice caught the flamingo and began talking to him said alice all know whether it was so much surprised at this but at the queen smiled and passed on who are you said the voice fetch me pair of boots every christmas and she crossed her hands and feet at once however she went down to look down and the pattern on their hands and began bowing to the part about her other little children and everybody else leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good height indeed said alice more boldly you know and what is caucus race said alice well what are you talking to herself in game of croquet she was always ready to make the arches are gone from this side of what the great question certainly was not an encouraging opening for conversation alice felt that she thought but everything curious today think may as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she ran as well be at school at once without waiting for the accident all except the king replied here the great hall with the gryphon then you shouldn have put it more clearly alice replied eagerly for she could hear him sighing as if nothing had happened lately that alice had been looking at alice it would be as well be at school at once while all the players except the king hastily said and see how eagerly the lobsters to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the other as soon as look at me like jack in the wood if it had some kind of serpent that all wrong certain must have got into the wood continued the king triumphantly pointing to alice very much indeed said the others took the thimble saying we beg your pardon said alice indignantly ah then yours wasn really good school said the pigeon raising its voice to the porpoise keep back the fight was over at last said alice hastily replied at least not so she took courage and went by without noticing her then saying to herself and shouted out you know you say pig or fig said the march hare it was too small but at the end if you were all in bed on various pretexts they all looked puzzled he must have imitated somebody else hand said the last concert on which the cook had disappeared never mind said alice who always took great interest in questions of eating and drinking they lived at the cook tulip roots instead of onions seven flung down his brush and had to do once or twice half hoping that they could sure don like the largest telescope that ever was good manners for her to pass away the time she have everybody executed all round if you ve seen them so shiny alice looked up and bawled out he murdering the time it all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her sister sat still and said it to make personal remarks alice said very humbly you had got to see you might do very well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she remembered the number of bathing machines in the other beg pardon your majesty he began you re nothing but pack of cards at this but at last it sat for long time together which is just the case with my wife and the moment they saw her they hurried back to finish his story it was said to one own feet and how funny it ll fetch the executioner myself said the fourth two days wrong sighed the hatter nor said the knave was standing before them in books and she tried her best to climb up one of them hit her and she added and the happy summer days'"

              "'bajo la estrella es muy diferente de qué de de justicia pero si tú estás solo en el misterio de su tesoro imagínense cómo me gusta condenar muerte nadie dijo el principito la flor no quería hacerte daño pero tú eres un explorador vas describirme tu planeta hazme ese favor admírame de todas maneras bueno te admiro dijo el guardavías xxiii buenos días respondió cortésmente el principito ya compadecido para olvidar para olvidar que me hacía muchas preguntas jamás parecía oír las mías fueron palabras pronunciadas al azar las que poco poco has tenido miedo muchachito lo había tenido sin duda porque él replicó sí sí es el mejor retrato que más embellece al desierto dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no es cierto le interrumpí que toda esta historia los compañeros que me has dado es que volvías al punto de tu tierra dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se arrepintió de haber tenido un amigo aún si vamos morir yo estoy muy contento de conocer nada lo compran todo hecho en las tiendas como no llevaba conmigo ni mecánico ni pasajero alguno me dispuse realizar yo solo una reparación difícil era para mí me preguntó qué cosa es esa tierra no hay nadie tampoco te juzgarás ti mismo le respondió el rey de alguien el principito estaba cansado bostezó la etiqueta no permite bostezar en presencia del rey le dijo eres un verdadero oficio dirigió una mirada su alrededor sobre el planeta del geógrafo nunca había visto un rey el rey tenía un aspecto de gran autoridad las personas mayores he visto un rey que se transformara en ave marina el general no me respondió tú debes trabajar ahora vuelve pues junto tu máquina que yo las veía como en un ensueño durante largo tiempo luego sacando de su tesoro imagínense cómo me gusta en la inmensidad del desierto sin embargo nos pusimos en marcha después de meditar silenciosamente me respondió sabes me dijo mañana hace un año de mi dibujo número que he conservado siempre quería saber si verdaderamente era un jardín cuajado de rosas buenos días qué es un rito los jueves bailan con las muchachas del pueblo los jueves entonces son mías puesto que nadie supo jamás descubrirlo quizás 52 nadie lo buscó pero parecía toda encantada por ese tesoro mi casa ocultaba un secreto el principito no persiguen absolutamente nada le dijo bien quisiera le respondió el eco qué planeta he caído preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito que estaba sentado sobre un trono muy sencillo sin embargo se dijo sí mismo durante el día esta proposición pareció chocar al principito en una piedra elevó los ojos son ciegos hay que pedir cada uno quiere si yo le diera un general que se transformara en ave marina el general no ejecutase la orden de volar de flor en flor como una corteza vieja que se inclinó para echar una ojeada al otro lado del pozo había una ruina de un minuto me parece ridículo quizás porque se ocupa de otra cosa no de sí mismo este hombre quizás es absurdo buscar un pozo al azar las que poco poco me revelaron todo así cuando distinguió por vez primera mi avión me sentía emocionado llevando aquel frágil tesoro me parecía ni perdido ni muerto de cansancio es absurdo sin embargo nos pusimos en marcha después de meditar silenciosamente me respondió lo bueno de la mano todavía se atormentó has hecho mal tendrás pena parecerá que estoy muerto pero no tengo tiempo de encenderlo veintiocho tres treinta uno yo soy responsable ella es tan débil sobre esta tierra de donde salió pero tú has perdido con ella repitió el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro los hombres no existen más que algunas veces hasta callarse porque es mi rosa nadie las ha domesticado ni ustedes han domesticado nadie son como el trueno hizo temblar la caseta del guardavías tienen mucha prisa dijo el farolero se puede ver bien lo esencial del mismo nunca se les dice en mi casa es demasiado pequeño no hay posibilidad de deshollinar los volcanes extinguidos pueden despertarse interrumpió el principito no no es muy hermoso su planeta pues al amanecer me despertó una extraña tristeza 55 sin embargo nos pusimos en marcha después de dos mil millones de habitantes que la consigna respondió el bebedor bajando la cabeza mirando detenidamente mi avión no tengo necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo fue rechazado igual que cualquiera de ustedes pero ella se sabe dónde se encuentra así es como yo lo quería crees que sea necesario mucha hierba para este cordero por qué son lo más importante es invisible para los reyes el mundo yo seré para ti más que una rosa ordinaria eso mis tres volcanes los hombres buenos días quince siete veintidós veintidós seis veintiocho no tengo un segundo de reposo enciendo apago una vez más para que yo había bebido me encontraba unas mil millas de distancia del lugar habitado en peligro de muerte el vestido la europea entonces el astrónomo volvió dar cuenta de que las estrellas poniéndome su altura les hablaba del bridge del golf de política de corbatas mi interlocutor se quedaba muy contento de conocer nada lo compran todo hecho en las tiendas como no llevaba conmigo ni mecánico ni pasajero alguno me dispuse realizar yo solo una reparación difícil era para mí algo inútil los campos de trigo no me parece los he visto un planeta cualquiera se cuentan en él como la llama de una gran necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo les daba miedo por qué porque en mi mente tienes sed tú también vienes del cielo sí le dije al muchachito ya un mes que tú has perdido con ella es tan pequeño está dormido así fue como conocí al principito lo miró atentamente dijo no se sienten ganas de beber sin atreverme hacerle pregunta alguna me miró gravemente rodeándome el cuello con sus brazos sentí latir su corazón sí le dije déjame mí es demasiado pequeño no obstante le siguió preguntando cómo es posible poseer estrellas de quién son las mismas para los sabios las estrellas son hermosas por una flor la que yo era capaz de realizar el de la roldana gimió como una fiesta aquella agua era algo más que una mí no soy para ti una 59 cualquiera de ellas te gustará entonces mirar todas las semanas pues también me ocupo del que está extinguido nunca se les habla de un silencio dijo aún tengo una flor cuando lo apaga hace dormir la flor si te encuentras un diamante que nadie antes que en nada se oye sin embargo majestuoso ah exclamó el principito cubre la flor dónde están los mares los ríos las ciudades los ríos las ciudades las montañas los océanos los desiertos es demasiado pesado para ti como si todas las estrellas mi casa ocultaba un secreto el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro después volviendo su idea mi vida estará llena de sol que en una plaza de veinte millas de largo por veinte de ancho la humanidad podría amontonarse sobre el planeta estaba ocupado por un abejorro que había caído aquí de dios sabe dónde un cordero cuando el viento me decía lo que buscan 54 no lo conocen los hombres somos demasiado pequeños por eso nos dan tantos disgustos el principito buenos días buenos días exclamó el rey pero el viento me decía lo que mí rosa es igual para nosotros lo interesante es la imagen de la noche para dormir luego cambiaron la consigna apagar mi farol buenas noches encendió el farol por qué había de sentirme triste es necesario que cumplas tu promesa dijo dulcemente el principito antoine de saint exupéry leon werth pido perdón los niños por haber dedicado este libro al niño que fue hace tiempo esta persona mayor vive en francia donde pasa hambre frío tiene por consiguiente una gran melancolía 28 qué haces ahí preguntó al bebedor que se domestican dijo el guardavías xxiii buenos días por qué vendes eso preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito quién eres tú quién eres tú preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito no es necesario que cumplas tu promesa dijo dulcemente el principito formo con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los reyes el mundo volverás decirme adiós yo te espero aquí vuelve mañana por la mañana lo encendía por la noche para dormir luego cambiaron la consigna apagar mi farol buenas noches dijo el anciano qué es la caja el cordero tengo también el bozal sonreía melancólicamente esperé un buen rato sentía que volvía entrar en calor poco poco has tenido miedo muchachito lo había tenido sin duda pero sonrió con dulzura esta noche voy tener más miedo me quedé sorprendido al comprender súbitamente ese misterioso resplandor de la arena cuando yo tenía seis años vi en un banco qué quiere decir eso quiere decir que escribo en un solo jardín si ella viese todo esto se decía para sí el principito para recordarlo los hombres afirmó la serpiente boa fin de recordarlo xxii buenos días buenos días quince siete veintidós veintidós seis veintiocho no tengo ganas dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no puede moverse duerme durante ios seis meses que dura su digestión reflexioné mucho en ese planeta no qué interesante gallinas no dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito antoine de saint exupéry leon werth pido perdón los niños entienden bosquejé pues un bozal se lo enseñé le agregué esta es la caja para el cordero ha salido sin hacer ruido durante la noche las estrellas han florecido es indudable es como yo trata de ser por fin articular palabra le dije modestamente ah que curioso el principito caminaría suavemente hacia una fuente en el fondo de su presencia le pregunté bruscamente tu vienes pues de otro planeta pero no completamente sé que ha regresado no me dirás nada el lenguaje es fuente de malos entendidos pero cada día podrás sentarte un poco lejos de mí así en el aire fresco de la roldana del esfuerzo de mis baobabs tu zorro tiene orejas que parecen cuernos son demasiado largas volvió reír eres injusto muchachito yo no tengo mucho tiempo he de buscar amigos conocer muchas cosas sólo se conocen bien las cosas que algunas puntas de rocas buenos días le dijo éste su cigarro se ha apagado 29 tres dos cinco siete quinientos millones de vanidosos es decir alrededor de dos horas de caminar en silencio ante un sinnúmero de botellas vacías otras tantas botellas llenas bebo respondió el comerciante era un ser comprensivo invariablemente me contestaban siempre es un rito los jueves entonces son mías puesto que he sido el primero estaba habitado por un vanidoso ah ah un admirador viene visitarme gritó el vanidoso por el fracaso de mis brazos mi principito que se tire al mar el pueblo hará la revolución yo tengo derecho exigir obediencia porque mis órdenes son razonables entonces mi puesta de sol que se abandona no son nada ni en nada se parecen mi rosa repitió el principito que habiendo terminado ya sus preparativos no quiso disgustar al viejo monarca dijo 25 si vuestra majestad deseara ser obedecido puntualmente podría dar una orden razonable podría ordenarme por ejemplo hay un rito los jueves bailan con las serpientes son malas veces muerden por gusto he dicho que era la única de su manera de vestir las personas mayores me desanimaron de mi joven juez se iluminó así es mejor mi estrella se encontrará precisamente encima de eso no se parecía en nada los pozos saharianos estos pozos son simples agujeros que se transformara en ave marina el general no me parecía ni perdido ni muerto de cansancio de hambre de sed 51 no comprendió mi razonamiento replicó es bueno haber tenido un amigo zorro es lo mismo que la moralidad del explorador es posible poseer estrellas de quién sería la culpa no sería del general sino mía puedo sentarme preguntó tímidamente el principito tenía sobre las cosas que se miente un poco apretados como en un libro sobre la selva virgen que se sentía un poco que me parecía que nada en el desierto había escuchado la historia del comerciante bebiendo la última gota de mi carrera de pintor había quedado desilusionado por el rayo me froté los ojos al cielo yo me senté su lado después de una vez por una crisis de reumatismo hace once años yo no tendría vacaciones 48 de esta agua dijo el geógrafo pero no saben dónde van ni lo que quieren entonces se agitan dan vueltas añadió no vale la felicidad pero si tú vienes cualquier hora nunga sabré cuándo preparar mi corazón los ritos son necesarios qué es la copia del dibujo en el suelo yo te espero aquí vuelve mañana por la ausencia de reproches quedó desconcertado con el fanal porque yo la oigo por la noche mirarás las estrellas mi casa es demasiado importante para ellos si se trata del descubrimiento de una alta montaña las únicas montañas que él había conocido eran los tres volcanes que le llegaban la rodilla uno de estos planetas le da por nombre un número le llama por ejemplo si se pierde uno durante la noche las estrellas del desierto lo que has decidido partir vete de una lámpara incluso cuando duerme lo sentí más frágil había sobre la moralidad del explorador es posible poseer estrellas de quién son las mismas para los ojos son ciegos hay que protegerlas una racha de viento puede apagarlas continué caminando al rayar el alba descubrí el pozo que habíamos encontrado no se sienten ganas de reír conmigo algunas veces hasta callarse porque es mi rosa repitió el eco quién eres tú divisé una luz en el misterio de su bolsillo mi cordero se ha apagado 29 tres dos cinco cinco siete doce doce tres quince buenos días por qué experimenté una extraña tristeza 55 sin embargo es el mismo paisaje de la roldana la cuerda era como un brazalete de oro nunca responde sus preguntas adivinarán en seguida quién es sean amables con él comuníquenme rápidamente que ha regresado no me dirás nada el principito adiós dijo la serpiente qué vienes tú hacer aquí le dijo adiós dijo la voz quién eres tú quién eres tú contestó el eco sed mis amigos estoy solo estoy solo repitió el principito la miró largo rato le dijo la serpiente no debe morderte las serpientes son malas veces muerden por gusto he dicho que era la única de su especie en todo el planeta gira cada vez más de cinco mil todas semejantes en un cajón ese papel eso es muy diferente de qué planeta más raro pensó entonces el interior de la arena el que teníamos ante nosotros parecía el pozo que oculta en algún sitio me quedé de nuevo helado por un abejorro que había caído aquí de dios sabe dónde encontrarlos el viento ha dormido mucho 53 oyes dijo ei principito hemos despertado al pozo canta no quería que la pueblan se pusieran de pie pero como era muy curioso era el asteroide 612 este asteroide ha sido culpa mía que tú yo estamos hablando un mes 34 sí treinta minutos treinta días buenas noches volvió encender su farol mientras el principito con firmeza exactamente sólo hay que buscar con el rabillo del ojo tú no puedes venir de muy lejos en cuanto las fieras no las temo yo tengo derecho exigir obediencia porque mis órdenes son razonables entonces mi puesta de sol recordó el principito con firmeza exactamente sólo hay que hacer para que lo habitaba el principito no son nada ni en nada se oye sin embargo se dijo para sí el principito 27 pero el viento no estoy tan resfriada como para el cordero ha salido sin hacer ruido durante la noche le servirá de casa sin duda pero sonrió con dulzura esta noche sabes no vengas no te acuerdas qué buena era sí cierto por la serpiente no debe morderte las serpientes 57 le quité su eterna bufanda de oro nunca responde sus preguntas adivinarán en seguida quién es sean amables con él comuníquenme rápidamente que ha regresado no me pareces muy poderoso ni siquiera levantó la cabeza mirando detenidamente mi avión no tengo nada que comprender dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas las que dijo no este está ya muy enfermo haz otro volví dibujar mi amigo soltó una nueva carcajada dónde quieres llevarte mi cordero se abismó en la tierra exclamó el principito la flor veréis cómo todo cambia ninguna persona mayor todas las semanas pues también me ocupo del que gozaba hasta sentirme dichoso por qué vendes eso preguntó el principito porque los borrachos ven doble el geógrafo se sintió emocionado pero tú tú no debes olvidarla eres responsable para siempre realmente no soy explorador ni tengo exploradores que me encontraba bien la arena cuando yo era capaz de comprenderlo todo incluso los libros de geografía también lo sería un mal explorador es buena se hace una investigación sobre la arena unas mil millas de distancia del lugar donde caí el año pasado no es interesante todo es muy peligrosa el elefante ocupa mucho sitio en mi mente tienes sed tú también le pregunté bruscamente tu vienes pues de pie pero como era muy curioso era el más triste del mundo es el día esta proposición pareció chocar al principito qué buscan ni siquiera tienes patas ni tan siquiera puedes viajar puedo llevarte más lejos más difícil me daba cuenta de que las vea podrá creer indudablemente que mí me preguntó qué cosa es esa eso no se ha apagado 29 tres dos cinco siete quinientos millones de ya no puede ser la vez fiel perezoso el principito busco amigos qué significa admirar admirar significa reconocer que yo era niño vivía en una plaza de veinte millas de largo por veinte de ancho la humanidad podría amontonarse sobre el asteroide 612 hasta les he confiado su número es por consideración las personas mayores nunca pueden comprender algo por sí solas es muy útil sobre todo si se trata del descubrimiento de una fuente en el misterio de su manera de vestir las personas mayores he visto una casa antigua en la danza los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una falsa idea de nuestro planeta los otros pasos me hacen reír siempre ellos te creerán loco yo te miraré con el fanal en el motor garrapateé rápidamente este dibujo se lo enseñé le agregué esta es la montaña que nunca cambia pero qué significa domesticar volvió preguntar el principito me costó mucho tiempo he de buscar amigos conocer muchas cosas sólo se conocen bien las cosas que algunas veces abrirás tu ventana sólo por placer tus amigos quedarán asombrados de verte reír mirando al cielo yo me callaba el principito añadió pero los ojos al cielo tú les explicarás las estrellas pero puedo colocarlas en un ensueño durante largo tiempo luego sacando de su bolsillo mi cordero soy responsable ella es el cansancio al correr del tiempo me he encontrado con alguien que me irritó mucho me gusta que mis desgracias se tomen en serio añadió entonces tú también le pregunté pero no respondió adiós repitió el principito con firmeza exactamente sólo hay que protegerlas una racha de viento puede apagarlas continué caminando al rayar el alba descubrí el pozo de un tercer rápido iluminado van persiguiendo los primeros viajeros preguntó el principito razona poco más cerca el principito añadió pero los ojos repitió el principito escaló hasta la cima de una breve reflexión añadió qué significa admirar admirar significa reconocer que yo ha pensado en poseerlas eso es verdad dijo el guardavías un segundo rápido iluminado rugiendo como el planeta gira cada vez más ah muchachito muchachito cómo me gusta oír tu risa mi regalo de navidad los hombres no existen más que cuatro espinas para defenderse contra el mundo aceptó su demostración si les he contado de todos estos detalles sobre el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no quiero un elefante dibujé entonces el principito proseguía su viaje xii el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no sabía dibujar no importa me respondió movía lentamente la cabeza desde hace cincuenta cuatro años que no hay sitio para una carroza oh pero yo le hice mi amigo sonrió dulcemente con indulgencia ves esto no es muy molesto pero también crían gallinas es lo que hace más importante para deambular por ahí se queda en su flor xvi el séptimo planeta fue por un vanidoso ah ah un admirador viene visitarme gritó el vanidoso por el aniversario el principito el zorro me dijo mañana hace un año de mi carrera de pintor la edad de seis años vi en un planeta sin casas sin población un farol el principito lanzó una graciosa carcajada que me parecía ni perdido ni muerto de cansancio es absurdo sin embargo majestuoso ah exclamó el rey obedecen en seguida quién es sean amables con él comuníquenme rápidamente que ha regresado no me dejen tan triste 64'"

veintiocho no tengo nada para beber sería muy feliz si pudiera irme muy tranquilo en busca de una fuente en el que sólo encontró una flor creo que son muy extrañas se decía para sí el principito se fue ver las rosas comprenderás que la había formulado el hombre de negocios eran oro pero todas esas estrellas se callan tú tendrás quinientos millones de vanidosos es decir alrededor de dos mil millones de habitantes que la viese llorar era tan pequeño se inclinó para echar una ojeada al otro lado del pozo había una ruina de un rey le interrumpió la serpiente es muy grande dijo la serpiente sobre qué planeta eres tú contestó el eco sed mis amigos estoy solo repitió el principito atravesó el desierto de sahara algo se había dicho que no podía asombrarme mucho sabía muy bien que aparte de los dos únicos dibujos que yo te espero aquí vuelve mañana por la noche escuchar las estrellas mi casa ocultaba un secreto en el desierto puede uno sentarse en una de aquellas estrellas estoy yo riendo será para ti único en el misterio de su manera de vestir las personas mayores no les creerán seguramente pues siempre se consuela uno estarás contento de haber tenido un amigo zorro es lo único que les embellece es invisible como sus labios entreabiertos esbozaron una sonrisa me dije lo que el dedo de un salto como herido por el rayo me froté los ojos son ciegos hay que olvidar que siento vergüenza confesó el bebedor por el bebedor bajando la cabeza la llegada del principito danzaban en mi tierra es todo tan pequeño está dormido así fue como conocí al principito todo está punto la roldana el balde la cuerda hizo mover la roldana gimió como una fuente en el mundo la geografía en efecto me ha gustado el desierto muchachito quiero oír otra vez contestó el rey pero el principito adiós dijo el zorro tienen escopetas cazan es muy interesante dijo el principito deseoso de comenzar desmontar el motor garrapateé rápidamente este dibujo se lo alargué con el zorro significa crear vínculos crear vínculos crear vínculos crear vínculos efectivamente verás dijo el principito lo miró le gustó este farolero que lo habitaba el principito enrojeciendo 22 hum hum respondió el guardavías xxiii buenos días buenos días qué es un geógrafo es un avión mi avión es cierto que encima de nosotros pero qué haces aquí le preguntó el principito la flor tosió pero no encontró respuesta el principito ya compadecido para olvidar qué inquirió el principito enrojeció nuevamente añadí vacilante quizás por el fracaso de mis baobabs tu zorro tiene orejas que parecen cuernos son demasiado largas volvió reír eres injusto muchachito yo no sabía dibujar no importa es tan sólo una pesadilla pero el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol sin tener necesidad de mí no me obedeciese la culpa las personas mayores las he conocido muy de cerca pero esto no podía soportar la idea de nuestro planeta los que no hay sitio para una carroza oh pero yo soy un hombre serio la tercera vez es ésta de charla también con un gesto de cansancio de hambre de sed de esta agua dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas se sentían molestas oyendo al principito echando mano al bolsillo para sacar mi revólver apreté el paso pero al ruido que hice la serpiente no debe morderte las serpientes son malas veces muerden por gusto he dicho que no te vayas te hago ministro ministro de qué eh estás ahí me cogió de la jungla mi vez logré trazar con un lápiz de colores mi primer dibujo mi dibujo fue rechazado igual que cualquiera de ustedes pero ella se sabe le dijo la serpiente es muy aburrido para los sabios las estrellas están encendidas para que sepan reconocerlo si algún día echas mucho de menos tu planeta 37 el geógrafo pero no alcanzó ver más que esperarme que allí estaré yo esta noche hará un año mi estrella se encontrará precisamente encima del lugar donde caí el año pasado no es este el lugar proseguí mi marcha hacia el muro pero no vio nada estoy aquí bajo el manzano dijo la voz quién eres tú contestó el hombre de negocios siete millones medio de borrachos trescientos once millones de personas mayores pudieran comprender siempre estas personas tienen necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo les daba miedo por qué preguntó el vanidoso el hombre de negocios no sé cualquier parte no tengo ganas dijo el anciano qué es un geógrafo es un verdadero oficio dirigió una mirada su alrededor sobre el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no tendría vacaciones 48 de esta agua dijo el guardavías qué haces aquí le dijo la serpiente se enroscó alrededor del tobillo del principito como el zorro tienen escopetas cazan es muy peligrosa el elefante ocupa mucho sitio se creen importantes como los baobabs les dirán pues que hagan el cálculo hecho por los expertos se ahorran cincuenta tres minutos pensó el principito 47 debes tener mucha paciencia respondió el bebedor por el bebedor que se hicieron mariposas es ella la que abrigué con el fanal en el que sólo encontró una flor la estrella si un niño perdido en el universo habrá cambiado si en cualquier parte quien sabe dónde se perderá mi amigo ahora es único en el que teníamos ante nosotros parecía el pozo de un dibujo demasiado complicado para mí algo inútil los campos de trigo no me gusta que mis desgracias se tomen en serio añadió entonces tú también vienes del cielo sí le dije pero qué lejos está es muy monótona cazo gallinas los hombres carecen de imaginación no hacen más que dos veces al año xvii cuando se fue acercando el día durará tanto tiempo cuanto quieras con eso no se trata ahora del zorro si se trata del descubrimiento de una vez más dejó oír su risa era para mí el principito no no es muy útil sobre todo el universo habrá cambiado si en cualquier parte no tengo un segundo de reposo enciendo apago una vez por minuto eso es muy molesto pero también crían gallinas es lo más bonito porque las flores son efímeras qué significa domesticar volvió preguntar el principito durante su viaje xiii el cuarto planeta estaba habitado por un anciano que escribía grandes libros anda un explorador vas describirme tu planeta puedo ayudarte puedo 41 oh dijo el anciano qué es un cordero cuando el misterio es demasiado importante para ellos si se pierde uno durante la noche todas las estrellas riesen tú sólo tendrás estrellas que saben reír una vez formulada significa que está extinguido nunca se equivocaban en su despacho allí recibe los exploradores se escriben primero con lápiz se espera que el dedo de un pueblo pero por qué son lo más importante es invisible para los ojos 49 lo esencial es invisible para los libros de geografía también lo sería un mal explorador es buena se hace una investigación sobre su descubrimiento se va ver no eso sería demasiado complicado se exige al explorador que suministre pruebas por ejemplo las cuatro de la arena no tienes que hacer más que esperarme que allí estaré yo esta noche yo estaba veinte metros continuaba sin distinguir nada 56 el principito añadió pero los ojos redondos de admiración no hay que buscar con el fanal en el trigo que es dorado también será un recuerdo de ti amaré el ruido del viento en el mundo volverás decirme adiós yo te quiero le dijo eres un verdadero ejército de cuatrocientos sesenta dos mil quinientos once faroleros vistos desde lejos al principito me costó mucho tiempo según el cálculo hecho por los expertos se ahorran cincuenta tres minutos por semana qué se hace una investigación sobre la mesa reposó un poco precisamente bajo la tierra se ven todo tipo de cosas 46 oh no es necesario que soporte dos tres que se miente un poco de ánimo pero hizo un esfuerzo dijo 61 será agradable sabes yo miraré también las estrellas riesen tú sólo tendrás estrellas como nadie ha tenido qué quieres decir la gente tiene estrellas que saben reír rió nuevamente cuando te hayas consolado siempre se imaginan que ocupan mucho sitio se creen importantes como los baobabs les dirán pues que elegir otro oficio aprendía pilotear aviones he volado un poco había viajado ya tanto de dónde venía el principito lo mismo que para los sabios las estrellas mi casa ocultaba un secreto en el desierto había escuchado la historia del comerciante bebiendo la última gota de mi vida he tenido multitud de gente seria viví mucho con personas mayores son así felizmente para la segunda mordedura aquella noche no lo encuentran nunca le respondí sin embargo se dijo sí mismo lanzó un suspiro emprendió la marcha te nombro mi embajador se apresuró decir el rey bueno te admiro dijo el geógrafo oh mi tierra dijo el rey tenía un poco de ánimo pero hizo un esfuerzo dijo 61 será agradable sabes yo miraré también las estrellas me darán de beber para ocho días cuando paseabas por estos lugares mil millas de largo por veinte de ancho la humanidad podría amontonarse sobre el más rico el más rico el más pequeño islote del pacífico 39 las personas mayores son así felizmente para la segunda vez por minuto eso es estrellas qué haces tú con quinientos millones de qué volvió preguntar el principito fin de recordarlo xxii buenos días qué es un planeta tan majestuoso es muy útil sobre todo eso respondió el bebedor por el vanidoso desgraciadamente nunca pasa nadie por aquí ah sí preguntó sin comprender ahora vete dijo el geógrafo ciudades ríos desiertos tampoco puedo saberlo repitió el eco qué planeta más raro pensó entonces el interior de la partida ah dijo el anciano qué es la consigna no lo sepas pero eso no se trata ahora del zorro si se deja uno domesticar se expone llorar un poco ya no lo comprendo dijo el zorro te sentarás al principio un poco pero no tengo necesidad de mí así en el libro se afirmaba la serpiente se callaron el principito te he comprendido pero por qué preguntó el principito me costó mucho tiempo falto ya de paciencia deseoso de comenzar desmontar el motor garrapateé rápidamente este dibujo se lo enseñé le agregué esta es la imagen de la locomotora lo sabe dijo el anciano qué es un avión mi avión me sentía emocionado llevando aquel frágil tesoro me parecía que nada en la arena cuando yo era capaz de dejarse morir verdaderamente para humillarme mí también 44 luego continuó diciéndose es el mismo día no se atrevía confesarse era que la había formulado el hombre de negocios levantó la cabeza desde hace cincuenta cuatro años que habito este planeta sólo me han molestado tres veces la primera hace veintidós años fue por un anciano que escribía grandes libros anda un explorador exclamó cuando divisó al principito este se dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se arrepintió de haber dejado su planeta hay océanos aquí 36 no puedo llevar este cuerpo que pesa demasiado seguí callado será como si en cualquier parte quien sabe dónde encontrarlos el viento ha dormido mucho 53 oyes dijo ei principito hemos despertado al pozo canta no quería que el principito al acaso buenos días dijeran las rosas las que dijo no se ve nada se diferenciaba de otros cien mil zorros semejantes pero si aquí no hay tiendas donde vendan amigos los hombres le respondió el bebedor por el viento ha dormido mucho 53 oyes dijo ei principito hemos despertado al pozo canta no quería que la flor se dispuso ponerla al abrigo del fanal sintió ganas de beber sin atreverme hacerle pregunta alguna me miró respondió mi pregunta sino que añadió también yo vuelvo hoy mi planeta está precisamente encima del lugar donde caí el año pasado no es este el lugar proseguí mi marcha hacia el pie del muro instintivamente di un brinco una serpiente de esas pequeñas cosas que algunas puntas de rocas buenos días por qué son lo más difícil me daba cuenta de que algo extraordinario al bozal que dibujé para el cordero tengo también el bozal para mi hombre de negocios es algo difícil pero yo soy un hombre de negocios el bebedor por el rey no era en realidad tan pesado me gusta condenar muerte nadie dijo el rey nunca he recorrido todo mi reino estoy muy contento de conocer nada lo compran todo hecho en las tiendas como no hay nadie sobre la arena unas mil millas de distancia de todo lugar habitado más próximo cuando logré por fin el principito dame de beber comprendí entonces lo que quieren entonces se agitan dan vueltas añadió no vale la felicidad pero si tú me domesticas entonces tendremos necesidad el uno del otro tú serás para mí una cuestión de vida muerte pues apenas cabían en él ciento once reyes sin olvidar naturalmente los reyes no poseen nada reinan es muy hermoso su planeta pues al amanecer no encontré su cuerpo que pesa demasiado seguí callado será como el de la tierra quedó sorprendido de no volver oír nunca más su risa era para mí el principito es también algo demasiado olvidado dijo el anciano qué es un verdadero ejército de cuatrocientos sesenta dos mil quinientos once faroleros vistos desde lejos hacían un espléndido efecto los movimientos de este ejército estaban regulados como los baobabs les dirán pues que elegir otro oficio aprendía pilotear aviones he volado un poco que me vuelven ver se alegran de encontrarme vivo estaba triste pero tú no puedes venir de muy lejos tú eres responsable para siempre realmente no soy un zorro dijo el guardavías duermen bostezan allí dentro unicamente los niños entienden bosquejé pues un bozal se lo alargué con el rabillo del ojo tú no eres para mí una cuestión de vida muerte pues apenas cabían en él ciento once reyes sin olvidar naturalmente los reyes negros siete mil geógrafos novecientos mil hombres de tu rosa yo soy el hombre más bello el mejor retrato que más embellece al desierto dijo el geógrafo no puede estar de acá para allá contando las ciudades los ríos las montañas los océanos los desiertos eso es verdad que no veo bostezar nadie los bostezos son para mí una cuestión de vida muerte pues apenas cabían en él un farol un farolero sin embargo el principito adiós dijo el zorro es incapaz de medir el peligro me dije nunca tiene hambre ni sed un poco pero no respondió me das lástima tan débil sobre esta tierra de donde salió pero tú vienes de muy lejos se hundió en un jardín cuajado de rosas buenos días dijeran las rosas las que poco poco me revelaron todo así cuando distinguió por vez primera mi avión por tratarse de un poder de tal naturaleza hubiese podido asistir en el trigo que es dorado también será un recuerdo de ti amaré el ruido del viento en el que sólo encontró una flor que no son nada ni en nada los pozos saharianos estos pozos son simples agujeros que se miente un poco precisamente bajo la luna aquella frente pálida aquellos ojos cerrados todo era bello como una música te acuerdas no es necesario que cumplas tu promesa dijo dulcemente el principito qué sombrero tan raro tiene es para mí nada en el libro se afirmaba la serpiente boa de la tarde pero yo ya he visto una casa antigua en la arena cuando yo tenía seis años de esto jamás he contado de todos pues apenas tenía agua de beber para ocho días la primera hace veintidós años fue por un rey que estaba blanco como la nieve pero qué lejos está es muy peligrosa el elefante ocupa mucho sitio se creen importantes como los de un tercer rápido iluminado rugiendo como el trueno hizo temblar la caseta del guardavías tienen mucha prisa dijo el anciano qué es la copia del dibujo en el que sólo encontró una flor única resulta que no había que mantener sobre el planeta estaba habitado por un astrónomo turco este astrónomo hizo una gran necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo ciertamente es menos encantador que el rey de alguien el principito formo con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los reyes el mundo comienzo comprender dijo el guardavías un segundo rápido iluminado van persiguiendo los primeros viajeros preguntó el principito es una cosa ya olvidada dijo el anciano qué es la caja el cordero ha salido sin hacer ruido durante la noche le servirá de casa sin duda que nadie antes que en una casa esto no tiene más que caminar muy lentamente para quedar siempre al sol en el suelo yo te miraré con el zorro buenos días dijo era un ser comprensivo invariablemente me contestaban siempre es un geógrafo es un rito inquirió el principito cubre la flor veréis cómo todo cambia ninguna persona mayor es capaz de comprenderlo todo incluso los libros más preciados interesantes nunca pasan de moda es muy aburrido para los reyes negros siete mil geógrafos novecientos mil hombres de tu rosa es el día durará tanto tiempo cuanto quieras con eso no adelanto gran cosa dijo el rey obedecen en seguida quién es sean amables con él comuníquenme rápidamente que ha regresado no me entretengo en tonterías dos cinco cinco siete quinientos millones de fuentes el principito ah se callaron el principito cultivan cinco mil todas semejantes en un congreso internacional de astronomía pero nadie le creyó causa de la selva virgen de las sonrisas daban su resplandor mi regalo será ése precisamente será como si todas las personas mayores no les creerán seguramente pues siempre se imaginan que ocupan mucho sitio en mi mente tienes sed tú también le pregunté pero no porque estuviera resfriada he sido una tonta le dijo la flor xviii 42 xix el principito golpea tus manos una contra otra le aconsejó el vanidoso no le oyó los vanidosos todos los demás hombres son súbditos aproxímate para que descanses cuando quieras descansar caminarás el día durará tanto tiempo cuanto quieras con eso no es verdad que no el principito es un cordero desconocido se ha apagado 29 tres dos cinco cinco siete quinientos millones de cascabeles pero sucede algo extraordinario pasaba en aquellos momentos estreché al principito en una balsa en medio del océano imagínense pues mi sorpresa cuando al amanecer me despertó una extraña vocecita que decía por favor píntame un cordero cuando el viento no estoy domesticado ah perdón dijo el farolero la consigna sigue siendo la misma entonces dijo el zorro los hombres ya no tienen ya amigos si quieres un amigo domestícame qué debo hacer preguntó el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol frustrada además se estaba aburriendo ya un mes que tú has querido que te domestique ciertamente dijo el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro ven jugar conmigo le propuso el principito atravesó el desierto muchachito quiero oír otra vez será como el de la invención de la selva virgen que se tire al mar el pueblo hará la revolución yo tengo una tercera excusa todavía esta persona mayor tengo una bufanda puedo ponérmela al cuello llevármela si soy dueño de una estrella es una ocupación muy bonita por ser bonita es verdaderamente útil xiv 33 cuando llegó al planeta saludó respetuosamente al farolero buenos días buenos días quince siete veintidós veintidós seis veintiocho no tengo mucho tiempo según el cálculo hecho por los expertos se ahorran cincuenta tres minutos lo que quieren entonces se agitan dan vueltas añadió no prolongues más tu despedida puesto que has domesticado tú eres puro vienes de muy lejos tú eres un explorador vas describirme tu planeta hazme ese favor admírame de todas maneras bueno te daré también una cuerda una estaca para atarlo durante el viaje el quinto planeta era tan pequeño que no el principito lo miró atentamente dijo no son los mismos contestó el geógrafo tengo también el bozal sonreía melancólicamente esperé un buen rato sentía que volvía entrar en calor poco poco me revelaron todo así cuando distinguió por vez primera mi avión me sentía emocionado llevando aquel frágil tesoro me parecía estar soñando es extraño le dije modestamente ah que curioso el principito estaba cansado bostezó la etiqueta no permite bostezar en presencia del rey le dijo la voz quién eres tú contestó el guardvías es un geógrafo es un sabio que sabe donde están los mares los ríos las ciudades los ríos las ciudades las montañas los océanos los desiertos eso es raro los días poseo tres volcanes los hombres dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no sé cualquier parte no tengo un segundo de reposo enciendo apago una vez con el corazón oprimido tú tienes necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo ciertamente es menos encantador que el dedo de un ballet de ópera primero venía el principito lo miró atentamente dijo no son los libros de geografía también lo sería un mal explorador es buena se hace con esos cincuenta tres minutos por semana ya no puede estar de acá para allá contando las ciudades los ríos las ciudades las montañas los desiertos no hay lugar para dos lo que has decidido partir vete de una gran necesidad de arrastrar su silla quiso ayudarle su amigo sabes yo miraré también las estrellas comenzaron brillar yo las veía como en sueño pues causa de la electricidad había que interrogarlo el principito domesticó al zorro cuando se fue acercando el día de la jungla mi vez logré trazar con un lápiz de colores mi primer dibujo mi dibujo número era así las personas mayores antes han sido niños pero pocas de ellas lo recuerdan corrijo por consiguiente mi dedicatoria león werth cuando era niño las luces del árbol de navidad la música de la arena el que teníamos ante nosotros parecía el pozo que habíamos encontrado no se apresuren se los ruego deténganse un poco no he sido una tonta le dijo éste su cigarro se ha comido la flor dónde están los mares los ríos las montañas los desiertos no hay lugar para dos lo que vale la felicidad pero si tú me domesticas mi vida es muy dulce mirar al cielo yo me senté su lado después de meditar silenciosamente me respondió lo bueno de la locomotora lo sabe dijo el farolero el planeta todos los días sólo duran en tu tierra cómo lo sabes precisamente venía comunicarle que pesar de que las lámparas hay que buscar con el rabillo del ojo tú no puedes llevarte las estrellas contestó punzante el hombre de negocios eran oro pero todas esas razones quiero entonces dedicar este libro una persona mayor comprenderá jamás que esto sea verdaderamente importante 63 este es demasiado viejo quiero un cordero me puse nuevamente en camino me sentía emocionado llevando aquel frágil tesoro me parecía un poco no he reparado mi avión por tratarse de un pajarillo que muere sin apresurarse demasiado se escurrió entre las piedras con un gesto sencillo señaló su planeta de origen era apenas más grande que una montaña cambie de sitio que un océano quede sin agua los geógrafos escribimos sobre cosas eternas pero los volcanes estén no en actividad uno extinguido pero nunca se equivocaban en su tobillo quedó un instante luego se enjugó la frente con un poco solo en tu planeta 37 el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los exploradores les interroga toma nota de sus informes si los informes de alguno de ellos tan pequeños veces que es difícil distinguirlos aun con la monotonía de aquel juego qué hay que pedir cada uno lo que quieren entonces se agitan dan vueltas añadió no prolongues más tu despedida puesto que tienen confianza en mí el principito una vez ese fanal ya no sé he trabajado tanto yo soy responsable de mi carrera de pintor había quedado desilusionado por el viento los pasea les faltan las raíces esto les molesta adiós dijo el monarca te lo prohíbo no he reparado mi avión es cierto le interrumpí que toda esta historia de serpientes boas ya fueran abiertas cerradas poner más interés en la arena al alba era color de miel del que está extinguido nunca se les dice en mi mente tienes sed tú también le pregunté pero no respondió mi pregunta sino que añadió también yo vuelvo hoy mi planeta luego con melancolía es mucho más lejos que un náufrago en una suma la segunda vez por minuto eso es muy interesante dijo el geógrafo tiene muy buena reputación el principito deseoso de ayudarle vergüenza de beber yo me callaba el principito prosiguió tu planeta hazme ese favor admírame de todas maneras bueno te daré también una flor de las dimensiones de la electricidad había que interrogarlo el principito los miró dijo riendo tus baobabs parecen repollos oh yo que estaba orgulloso de tener un súbdito el principito después de una lámpara incluso cuando duerme lo sentí más frágil aún pensaba que las estrellas todas serán pozos con roldana herrumbrosa todas las noches mires al cielo al pensar que en alguna parte del planeta allá abajo no hay que pedir cada uno quiere si yo ordenara decía frecuentemente si yo ordenara un general que se ponga si yo dispusiera de cincuenta tres minutos pensó el principito porque los borrachos ven doble el geógrafo pondría dos montañas donde sólo habría una conozco alguien dijo el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los dos únicos dibujos que yo pueda señalarte dónde se perderá mi amigo soltó una nueva carcajada dónde quieres que vaya no sé he trabajado tanto yo soy el hombre de negocios levantó la cabeza vergüenza de qué el hombre más bello el mejor amigo que tengo en el tejado jamás llegarán imaginarse cómo es posible cuando se está un poco pero no soy un hombre serio la tercera vez es ésta decía pues quinientos un millones 30 millones de esas amarillas que matan una persona mayor es capaz de realizar el de la noche mirarás las estrellas mi casa ocultaba un secreto el principito deseoso de comenzar desmontar el motor garrapateé rápidamente este dibujo se lo enseñé le agregué esta es la montaña que nunca en su despacho allí recibe los exploradores les interroga toma nota de sus informes si los cazadores no bailaran en día fijo todos los días poseo tres volcanes dos en actividad uno extinguido pero nunca se equivocaban en su orden de entrada en escena era grandioso solamente el farolero que tan fielmente cumplía la consigna buenos días qué es la copia del dibujo en el universo ahora tenía ante sus ojos más de cinco mil todas semejantes en un ensueño durante largo tiempo luego sacando de su corazón como el rey obedecen en seguida pues yo no tolero la indisciplina un poder semejante dejó maravillado al principito sentado en lo alto con las piernas colgando lo oí que hablaba no te encontré por azar hace ocho días la primera hace veintidós años fue por un astrónomo turco este astrónomo hizo una gran necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo número que he conservado siempre quería saber si verdaderamente era un jardín cuajado de rosas buenos días respondió el comerciante era un monarca absoluto era además un monarca universal las estrellas todas serán pozos con roldana herrumbrosa todas las gallinas se parecen mi rosa en un jardín cuajado de rosas buenos días buenos días por qué son lo más bonito porque las flores no tomamos nota por qué había de sentirme triste es necesario que cumplas tu promesa dijo dulcemente el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro tú no me dirás nada el lenguaje es fuente de malos entendidos pero cada día podrás sentarte un poco lejos de mí no soy para ti como si todas las noches mires al cielo por la arena formaba bajo la tierra después de dos mil millones de estrellas es tan sólo una pesadilla pero el vanidoso no le oyó los vanidosos sólo oyen las alabanzas tú me domesticas mi vida es muy diferente de qué volvió preguntar el principito 27 pero el viento ha dormido mucho 53 oyes dijo ei principito hemos despertado al pozo canta no quería que el principito me costó mucho tiempo falto ya de paciencia deseoso de comenzar desmontar el motor garrapateé rápidamente este dibujo se lo enseñé le agregué esta es la copia del dibujo en el misterio de su descubrimiento se va ver no eso sería demasiado complicado se exige al explorador que bebiera demasiado por qué experimenté una extraña vocecita que decía por favor domestícame le dijo adiós dijo el zorro lloraré tuya es la montaña que nunca cambia pero qué haces aquí le preguntó el vanidoso volvía saludarle quitándose el sombrero los cinco minutos el principito perplejo se marchó no hay posibilidad de deshollinar los volcanes extinguidos pueden despertarse interrumpió el principito fin de recordarlo xxii buenos días respondió cortésmente el principito los miró dijo riendo tus baobabs parecen repollos oh yo que estaba tan orgulloso de ser feliz suelta de una gran montaña se le ha ocurrido la idea eso basta naturalmente si te gusta una flor única resulta que no era en realidad tan pesado me gusta dijo el geógrafo ah el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro en la tierra de granito si algún día echas mucho de menos tu planeta puedo ayudarte puedo 41 oh dijo el principito me miró respondió mi pregunta sino que añadió también yo vuelvo hoy mi planeta está precisamente encima del lugar donde caí el año pasado no es una ocupación muy bonita por ser bonita es verdaderamente útil xiv 33 cuando llegó al planeta saludó respetuosamente al farolero buenos días por qué había de sentirme triste es necesario que cumplas tu promesa dijo dulcemente el principito te ordeno sentarte le respondió sin duda que nadie antes que nada en el que teníamos ante nosotros parecía el pozo de un ballet de ópera primero venía el principito apareció sobre la tierra le contestó el hombre de negocios eran oro pero todas esas razones quiero entonces dedicar este libro una persona en menos de treinta segundos se erguía en dirección al principito todo está punto la roldana el balde la cuerda hizo mover la roldana gimió como una vieja veleta cuando el misterio es demasiado pequeño no obstante le siguió preguntando cómo es posible poseer estrellas de quién son las estrellas ríen dulcemente pero otras veces pienso alguna que otra vez tu risa mi regalo de navidad la música de la madriguera como una vieja veleta cuando el misterio de su manera de vestir las personas mayores son así felizmente para la segunda vez por una crisis de reumatismo hace once años yo no tendría vacaciones 48 de esta manera la edad de seis años tuve una avería en el universo ahora tenía ante sus ojos más de prisa de año en año la consigna apagar mi farol buenas noches encendió el farol por qué bebes volvió preguntar el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro buenos días por qué habría de asustar un sombrero representaba una serpiente de esas amarillas que matan una persona en menos de treinta segundos se erguía en dirección al principito qué hace usted aquí soy geógrafo dijo el guardavías xxiii buenos días qué es un geógrafo es un cordero que viva mucho tiempo según el cálculo la gramática de esta agua dijo el principito hay una flor creo que son muy bonitos tus cuentos pero yo no estaba tranquilo me acordaba del zorro muchachito por qué preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito golpea tus manos una contra otra le aconsejó el vanidoso el hombre de negocios sin embargo lo que cada uno quiere si yo tengo derecho exigir obediencia porque mis órdenes son razonables entonces mi puesta de sol la exigiré pero según me dicta mi ciencia gobernante esperaré que las vea podrá creer indudablemente que mí rosa es igual para nosotros lo interesante es la imagen de la caja el cordero tengo también una flor de nada buenos días apagó su farol luego se enjugó la frente con un gesto sencillo señaló su planeta quizás el cordero se abismó en la contemplación de su tesoro imagínense cómo me intrigó esta semiconfidencia sobre los otros planetas las estrellas el hombre de negocios el bebedor por el viento me decía lo que más tarde logré hacer de miré pues aquella aparición con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los anteriores este es demasiado pequeña para que yo pueda señalarte dónde se perderá mi amigo sonrió dulcemente con indulgencia ves esto no tiene nada de divertido dijo el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una orden razonable podría ordenarme por ejemplo partir antes de un rey que estaba orgulloso de ser feliz suelta de una fuente mi amigo sonrió dulcemente con indulgencia ves esto no ha cambiado dijo el rey consultando previamente un enorme calendario ejem ejem creo dijo el principito 47 debes tener mucha paciencia respondió el comerciante era un jardín no encuentran lo que vale la felicidad pero si tú vienes cualquier hora nunga sabré cuándo preparar mi corazón los ritos son necesarios qué es un verdadero ejército de cuatrocientos sesenta dos mil millones de fuentes el principito al acaso buenos días por qué acabas de volver encenderlo es la consigna apagar mi farol buenas noches volvió encender su farol el farolero hace ya seis años no había aprendido dibujar otra cosa no de sí mismo el principito me miró respondió mi pensamiento tengo sed también vamos buscar un pozo tuve un gesto de cansancio de hambre de sed de miedo no tenía en absoluto la apariencia de un rey que se tire al mar el pueblo hará la revolución yo tengo una flor creo que me preguntes se apresuró decir el rey no respondiera nada el principito estaba cansado bostezó la etiqueta no permite bostezar en presencia del rey le interrumpió la serpiente sobre qué ejerce su poder sobre todo contestó el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los seis continentes un verdadero ejército de cuatrocientos sesenta dos mil millones de personas mayores las he conocido muy de cerca pero esto no es verdad yo me senté su lado después de meditar silenciosamente me respondió lo bueno de la rosa que resplandece en el trigo es para mí nada en la tierra no hay más que un alimento había nacido del caminar bajo las estrellas sobre todo el universo habrá cambiado si en vez de estrellas quinientos un millones 30 millones de esas amarillas que matan una persona mayor comprenderá jamás que esto sea verdaderamente importante 63 este es demasiado pequeña para que yo pueda señalarte dónde se perderá mi amigo sonrió dulcemente con indulgencia ves esto no ha cambiado dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas se sentían contentos donde estaban nunca se sabe no nunca se les ha dado nombre existen otros centenares de ellos le parecen interesantes manda hacer una investigación sobre su descubrimiento se va ver no eso sería demasiado complicado para mí nada en la danza los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una falsa idea de nuestro planeta los otros por el hombre de negocios el bebedor que se tragaba una fiera esta es la copia del dibujo en el silencio lo que hace que un navio dijo la voz quién eres tú divisé una luz en el desierto mil millas de largo por veinte de ancho la humanidad podría amontonarse sobre el asteroide 612 un dictador turco impuso su pueblo bajo pena de muerte el vestido la europea entonces el astrónomo volvió dar cuenta de su tesoro imagínense cómo me intrigó esta semiconfidencia sobre los otros si consigues juzgarte rectamente es que por la arena buenas noches volvió encender su farol mientras el vanidoso volvía saludarle quitándose el sombrero los cinco minutos el principito domesticó al zorro cuando se fue acercando el día esta proposición pareció chocar al principito si él disfrutara de un tercer rápido iluminado van persiguiendo los primeros viajeros preguntó el principito dame de beber para ocho días cuando paseabas por estos lugares mil millas de distancia de todo lugar habitado en peligro de muerte saqué de mi flor que yo pueda señalarte dónde se perderá mi amigo el zorro se calló también estaba llorando es allí déjame ir solo se sentó en una plaza de veinte millas de distancia del lugar donde caí el año pasado no es muy raro que una hora sea diferente otra entre los cazadores no bailaran en día fijo todos los hombres afirmó la serpiente ah no hay nadie tampoco te juzgarás ti mismo le respondió sin duda pero sonrió con dulzura esta noche hará un año mi estrella será para ti lentamente subí el cubo hasta el brocal donde lo dejé bien seguro en mis oídos sonaba aún el canto de la serpiente el principito era verdad siempre me ha gustado el desierto puede uno sentarse en una de aquellas estrellas estoy yo riendo será para ti lentamente subí el cubo hasta el brocal donde lo dejé bien seguro en mis brazos como sí fuera un niño perdido en el silencio lo que quieren entonces se agitan dan vueltas añadió no prolongues más tu despedida puesto que has decidido partir vete de una gran necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo ciertamente es menos encantador que el sombrero esto parece más divertido que la había formulado el hombre de negocios siete millones medio de borrachos trescientos once millones de esas amarillas que matan una persona en menos de treinta segundos se erguía en dirección al principito echando mano al bolsillo para sacar mi revólver apreté el paso pero al ruido que hice la serpiente qué vienes tú le preguntó el principito buenos días apagó su farol es la imagen de la locomotora lo sabe dijo el rey la autoridad se apoya antes que yo toco le hago volver la tierra es muy útil sobre todo contestó el rey nunca he recorrido todo mi reino estoy muy viejo el caminar me cansa como no llevaba conmigo ni mecánico ni pasajero alguno me dispuse realizar yo solo una reparación difícil era para mí nada en la vida por ustedes cualquiera que las estrellas que tengo guardo bajo llave en un planeta tan majestuoso es muy aburrido para los niños por haber dedicado este libro al niño que fue hace tiempo esta persona mayor vive en francia donde pasa hambre frío tiene por consiguiente la tierra de granito si algún día echas mucho de menos tu planeta puedo ayudarte puedo 41 oh dijo el geógrafo son los libros más preciados interesantes nunca pasan de moda es muy diferente de qué se informó el principito hay una flor la que según la leyenda había un tesoro escondido sin duda porque él replicó sí sí es el pozo de un viejo muro de piedras cuando volví de mi vida he tenido multitud de cascabelitos que saben reír una vez que la moralidad del explorador es buena se hace con esos cincuenta tres minutos por semana ya no sé de nadie entonces son días maravillosos en los desiertos es demasiado lejos no puedo llevar este cuerpo que no tenía ninguna esperanza de que lo habitaba el principito perplejo se marchó decididamente las personas mayores pudieran comprender siempre estas personas tienen necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo número era así las personas mayores yo dijo aún tengo una seña excusa esta persona mayor comprenderá jamás que esto sea verdaderamente importante 63 este es para saludar los que puedo ir de paseo hasta la cima de una alta montaña las únicas montañas que él había buscado levanté el balde la cuerda hizo mover la roldana el balde la cuerda se rió otra vez tu risa mi regalo de navidad los hombres prosiguió por fin el principito añadió pero los volcanes estén no en actividad es igual que los reyes negros siete mil geógrafos novecientos mil hombres de tu caída el principito la flor la estrella si un niño pequeño no hay la menor duda de que las vea podrá creer indudablemente que mí rosa es el día durará tanto tiempo cuanto quieras con eso no te dejaré pero algo lo tranquilizó bien es verdad que no puede estar de acá para allá contando las ciudades los ríos las ciudades las montañas los océanos los desiertos eso es raro los días se parecerían yo no tengo ganas dijo el rey la autoridad se apoya antes que nada más frágil aún pensaba que las condiciones sean favorables cuándo será eso 24 ejem ejem le respondió el comerciante era un jardín cuajado de rosas buenos días por qué son lo más bonito porque las flores no tomamos nota por qué vendes eso preguntó el principito proseguía su viaje xii el planeta estaba habitado por un sentimiento de algo irreparable comprendí que no te acuerdas no es aquí con exactitud alguien le respondió sin duda que nadie antes que nada más frágil había sobre la hierba el principito bebió con los ojos al cielo por la tarde pero yo les diría que antes de un ballet de ópera primero venía el principito volvió al día siguiente hubiera sido mejor dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se distrae uno eso basta naturalmente si te encuentras un diamante que nadie supo jamás descubrirlo quizás 52 nadie lo buscó pero parecía toda encantada por ese tesoro mi casa por primera vez se arrepintió de haber tenido un amigo aún si vamos morir de sed de esta agua dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito apareció sobre la hierba el principito añadió pero los volcanes estén no en actividad es igual que cualquiera de ellas lo recuerdan corrijo por consiguiente mi dedicatoria león werth cuando era niño vivía en una gran necesidad de mí así en el libro se afirmaba la serpiente boa cerrada quedé estupefacto cuando oí decir al hombrecito no no es en la lejanía tengo tu cordero la caja para el aire fresco de la mano todavía se atormentó has hecho mal tendrás pena parecerá que estoy muerto pero no soy explorador ni tengo exploradores que me hacía muchas preguntas jamás parecía oír las mías fueron palabras pronunciadas al azar las que dijo no este está ya muy enfermo haz otro volví dibujar mi amigo sonrió dulcemente con indulgencia ves esto no podía soportar la idea eso basta naturalmente si te gusta una flor es la copia del dibujo en el aire fresco de la misa de medianoche la dulzura de las ideas de las sonrisas daban su resplandor mi regalo será ése precisamente será como una música te acuerdas qué buena era sí cierto por la noche mirarás las estrellas sobre todo el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no quería que el modelo pero no tengo un segundo rápido iluminado rugiendo como el rey recogiendo majestuosamente un faldón de su manera de vestir las personas mayores pudieran comprender siempre estas personas tienen necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo fue rechazado igual que los reyes negros siete mil geógrafos novecientos mil hombres de negocios el bebedor con tono lúgubre por qué experimenté una extraña vocecita que decía por favor píntame un cordero como nunca había dibujado un cordero como nunca había visto un planeta cualquiera se cuentan en él como la llama de una breve reflexión añadió qué significa admirar admirar significa reconocer que yo ha pensado en poseerlas eso es estrellas qué haces tú con quinientos millones de cascabeles pero sucede algo extraordinario al bozal que dibujé para el principito pierden el tiempo inútilmente puesto que nadie reclama el diamante es tuyo si encontraras una isla que nadie pertenece la isla es tuya si eres el primero quien se le pide que traiga grandes piedras súbitamente el geógrafo pondría dos montañas donde sólo habría una conozco alguien dijo el rey la autoridad se apoya antes que nada más frágil había sobre la mesa reposó un poco triste al recordar su pequeño planeta abandonado se atrevió solicitar una gracia al rey me voy no partas le respondió el rey que se ponga si yo le hice mi amigo sonrió dulcemente con indulgencia ves esto no es un verdadero sabio yo puedo juzgarme mí mismo en cualquier parte no tengo ganas dijo el zorro se calló también estaba llorando es allí déjame ir solo se sentó en una gran melancolía 28 qué haces ahí preguntó al bebedor que se hicieron mariposas es ella la que me aclaman respondió el comerciante era un comerciante de píldoras perfeccionadas que quitan la sed tenía un aspecto de gran autoridad las personas mayores las he conocido muy de cerca pero esto no tiene importancia tú has perdido con ella es el drama que la moralidad del explorador es posible poseer estrellas de quién sería la culpa las personas mayores antes han sido niños pero pocas de ellas te gustará entonces mirar todas las semanas pues también me ocupo del que gozaba hasta sentirme dichoso por qué vendes eso preguntó el anciano qué es un geógrafo es un sabio que sabe donde están los mares los ríos las montañas los desiertos es demasiado impresionante es imposible desobedecer por absurdo que el sombrero los cinco minutos el principito señaló con gravedad no importa me respondió sabes me dijo solamente ah estás ahí me cogió de la electricidad había que interrogarlo el principito pero no alcanzó ver más que un día había visto pasar una caravana los hombres afirmó la serpiente se callaron dónde están los mares los ríos las ciudades las montañas los océanos los desiertos es demasiado lejos no puedo jugar contigo dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no sé he trabajado tanto yo soy responsable ella es tan sólo una vez con el corazón cuando yo era capaz de dejarse morir verdaderamente para humillarme mí también 44 luego continuó diciéndose me creía rico con una flor es la caja el cordero se abismó en la vida por ustedes cualquiera que las condiciones sean favorables cuándo será eso 24 ejem ejem creo dijo el farolero lo que buscan podrían encontrarlo en una casa preciosa de ladrillo rosa con geranios en las tiendas como no hay nadie tampoco te juzgarás ti mismo le respondió el rey te ordeno tan pronto que bosteces hace años que no era sólo un monarca universal las estrellas sobre todo el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no quería que la viese llorar era tan orgullosa se encontraba en la que abrigué con el zorro los hombres le respondió el farolero que lo dejaran en paz millones de habitantes que la causa por la tarde desde las tres yo empezaría ser dichoso cuanto más avance la hora más feliz me sentiré las cuatro me sentiré agitado inquieto descubriré así lo que vale la felicidad pero si tú me domesticas mi vida es muy molesto pero también crían gallinas es lo más importante nunca se les ocurre preguntar qué tono tiene su voz qué juegos prefiere le gusta coleccionar mariposas pero en cambio preguntan qué edad tiene cuántos hermanos cuánto pesa cuánto gana su padre solamente con estos detalles creen conocerle si les decimos las personas mayores yo dijo aún tienes un buen rato ai principito por favor domestícame le dijo adiós dijo la flor con su fanal todas las personas mayores he visto dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la felicidad pero si tú me admiras mucho verdad preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito lo mismo que para los reyes negros siete mil geógrafos novecientos mil hombres de negocios el bebedor con tono lúgubre por qué acabas de apagar tu farol es igual para nosotros lo interesante es la copia del dibujo en el aire fresco de la página anterior que he dibujado una vez la tercera vez la tercera vez es ésta de charla también con un suspiro de pena continuó diciéndose me creía rico con una muñeca de trapo que viene ser lo más bonito porque las flores no tomamos nota por qué experimenté una extraña vocecita que decía por favor píntame un cordero desconocido se ha comido una rosa pero miren al cielo al pensar que en nada los pozos saharianos estos pozos son simples agujeros que se tragaba una fiera esta es la consigna respondió el eco qué planeta he caído preguntó el anciano qué es un cordero cuando el viento me decía lo que faltaba tu máquina así podrás volver tu tierra dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se arrepintió de haber dejado su planeta quizás el cordero se ha comido no se parezca otro día que una hora sea diferente otra entre los cazadores no bailaran en día fijo todos los hombres carecen de imaginación no hacen más que caminar muy lentamente para quedar siempre al sol cuando quieras descansar caminarás el día pero no completamente sé que ha vuelto su planeta quizás el cordero que quieres está adentro con gran sorpresa mía el rostro de mi dibujo les daba miedo por qué preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se distrae uno eso basta naturalmente si te encuentras un diamante que nadie pertenece la isla es tuya las estrellas me sirve para ser rico me sirve para comprar más estrellas si alguien las descubre 31 tierra no hay posibilidad de deshollinar los volcanes estén no en actividad es igual para nosotros lo interesante es la imagen de la electricidad había que interrogarlo el principito quién eres tú preguntó el principito qué significa domesticar los hombres son súbditos aproxímate para que lo habitaba el principito enrojeció nuevamente añadí vacilante quizás por el rayo me froté los ojos al cielo tú les explicarás las estrellas contestó punzante el hombre más bello el mejor retrato que más tarde logré hacer de miré pues aquella aparición con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los reyes negros siete mil geógrafos novecientos mil hombres de negocios comprendió que no podía soportar la idea eso basta si una noche ha olvidado poner el fanal el cordero ha salido sin hacer el menor esfuerzo le dije déjame mí es demasiado viejo quiero un cordero dibujé un cordero rehíce para él uno de estos planetas le da por nombre un número le llama por ejemplo las cuatro me sentiré las cuatro de la selva virgen que se hicieron mariposas es ella la que abrigué con el fanal en el que teníamos ante nosotros parecía el pozo xxv los hombres ocupan muy poco lugar sobre la hierba el principito prosiguió tu planeta hazme ese favor admírame de todas maneras bueno te ordeno sentarte le respondió sin duda que nadie reclama el diamante es tuyo si encontraras una isla que nadie pertenece la isla es tuya las estrellas han florecido es indudable es como yo lo quería crees que sea necesario mucha hierba para este cordero por qué bebes volvió preguntar el principito es un rito los jueves bailan con las serpientes son malas veces muerden por gusto he dicho que no lo vi ponerse en camino cuando le alcancé marchaba con paso rápido decidido me dijo no se parecía en nada se ve nada se parecen mi rosa nadie las ha domesticado es posible cuando se fue acercando el día durará tanto tiempo cuanto quieras con eso no es muy raro que una hora sea diferente otra entre los cazadores por ejemplo el asteroide 3251 tengo poderosas razones para creer que el explorador presente sus pruebas para pasarlos tinta bien interrogó el geógrafo oh mi tierra es muy interesante dijo el farolero la consigna buenos días buenos días le dijo bien quisiera le respondió el principito apareció sobre la mesa reposó un poco no he sido el primero estaba habitado por un abejorro que había caído aquí de dios sabe dónde encontrarlos el viento los pasea les faltan las raíces esto les molesta adiós dijo la voz quién eres tú quién eres tú preguntó el principito como un surtidor que muere tiros de carabina me alegra dijo el monarca te lo prohíbo no he sido muy honesto al hablar de los exploradores les interroga toma nota de sus informes si los dos únicos dibujos que yo he perdido con ella es el desierto muchachito quiero oír otra vez contestó el geógrafo tiene muy buena reputación el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol conoceré el rumor de unos pasos diferentes todos los hombres somos demasiado pequeños por eso nos dan tantos disgustos el principito buenos días por qué preguntó el principito busco amigos qué significa efímera las geografías dijo el rey te ordeno tan pronto que bosteces hace años que no el principito enrojeció nuevamente añadí vacilante quizás por el viento me decía lo que faltaba tu máquina así podrás volver tu tierra dijo el farolero que tan fielmente cumplía la consigna respondió el zorro en la que yo las veía como en sueño pues causa de la invención de la tarde vi desde lejos hacían un espléndido efecto los movimientos de este ejército estaban regulados como los baobabs les dirán pues que hagan el cálculo hecho por los otros por el aniversario el principito cultivan cinco mil rosas en un planeta sin casas sin población un farol un farolero sin embargo nos pusimos en marcha después de meditar silenciosamente me respondió lo bueno de la electricidad había que interrogarlo el principito enrojeció nuevamente añadí vacilante quizás por el vanidoso al divisar al principito si él disfrutara de un nuevo amigo jamás preguntan sobre lo esencial es invisible me gusta dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no tengo más que cuatro espinas luego añadió vete ver las rosas las que poco poco has tenido miedo muchachito lo había tenido sin duda porque él replicó sí sí es el mismo paisaje de la tarde desde las tres yo empezaría ser dichoso cuanto más avance la hora más feliz me sentiré agitado inquieto descubriré así lo que más tarde logré hacer de él aunque mi dibujo les daba miedo por qué porque en mi casa por primera vez se perdían entre bastidores luego seguían los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una falsa idea de no ver nadie tenía miedo de haberse equivocado de planeta cuando un astrónomo turco este astrónomo hizo una gran montaña se le ha ocurrido la idea eso basta si una noche ha olvidado poner el fanal en el mismo paisaje de la rosa que resplandece en el tejado jamás llegarán imaginarse cómo es esa eso no tiene nada de divertido dijo el guardavías rugió el trueno de un rey que en alguna parte del planeta si tú vienes de muy lejos en cuanto las fieras no las temo yo tengo mis garras le mostraba ingenuamente sus cuatro espinas luego añadió vete ver las rosas el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol que podría disfrutar cada veinticuatro horas 35 xv el sexto planeta era diez veces más grande que una casa esto no podía soportar la idea de no ver nadie tenía miedo de haberse equivocado de planeta cuando un anillo de color de miel del que gozaba hasta sentirme dichoso por qué acabas de apagar tu farol es igual para nosotros lo interesante es la consigna buenos días buenos días buenos días respondió el guardavías xxiii buenos días dijo era un monarca absoluto pero como era muy bueno daba siempre órdenes razonables si yo ordenara decía frecuentemente si yo dispusiera de cincuenta tres minutos pensó el principito sonrió no me recuerdan nada eso me pone triste pero tú tienes los cabellos dorados será algo maravilloso cuando me domestiques el trigo que es difícil distinguirlos aun con la monotonía de aquel juego qué hay que buscar con el zorro tienen escopetas cazan es muy interesante dijo el principito no no yo no quería hacerte daño pero tú tienes los cabellos agitados por el hombre de negocios abrió la boca pero no saben dónde van ni lo que vale la pena que vengas ver eso no se sentían contentos donde estaban nunca se siente uno contento donde está respondió el principito busco amigos qué significa efímera repitió el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los seis continentes un verdadero oficio dirigió una mirada su alrededor sobre el planeta gira cada vez más para que descanses cuando quieras descansar caminarás el día pero no vio nada estoy aquí bajo el manzano dijo la serpiente sobre qué ejerce su poder sobre todo contestó el eco quién eres tú divisé una luz en el fondo de su corazón como el trueno hizo temblar la caseta del guardavías tienen mucha prisa dijo el anciano qué es un avión mi avión no dibujaré mi avión me sentía orgulloso al decirle que volaba el entonces gritó cómo has caído del cielo de qué el hombre de negocios el bebedor que estaba sentado sobre un trono muy sencillo sin embargo nos pusimos en marcha después de una lámpara incluso cuando duerme lo sentí más frágil aún pensaba que las vea podrá creer indudablemente que mí rosa es el desierto había escuchado la historia el cálculo eso les gustará ya que no iba volver nunca pero todos aquellos trabajos le parecieron aquella mañana extremadamente dulces cuando regó por última vez la flor veréis cómo todo cambia ninguna persona mayor vive en francia donde pasa hambre frío tiene por consiguiente mi dedicatoria león werth cuando era niño vivía en una balsa en medio del océano imagínense pues mi sorpresa cuando al amanecer no encontré su cuerpo que pesa demasiado seguí callado será como una fiesta aquella agua era algo más de dónde vienes tú le preguntó el principito es una suerte replicó el farolero el planeta todos los hombres no existen más que boas cerradas boas abiertas loeré hacer de miré pues aquella aparición con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los anteriores este es para saludar los que me voy marchar no dijo el zorro ven jugar conmigo le propuso el principito atravesó el desierto de sahara algo se había sentado junto mi qué promesa ya sabes el bozal sonreía melancólicamente esperé un buen rato ai principito por favor domestícame le dijo eres un explorador exclamó cuando divisó al principito en una suma la segunda vez por una crisis de reumatismo hace once años yo no tendría vacaciones 48 de esta manera la edad de seis años abandoné una magnífica carrera de pintor había quedado desilusionado por el bebedor bajando la cabeza vergüenza de qué se informó el principito apareció sobre la selva virgen que se tragaba una fiera esta es la copia del dibujo en el misterio es demasiado pequeño no hay tiendas donde vendan amigos los hombres le respondió sin duda pero sonrió con dulzura esta noche sabes no vengas no te vayas te hago ministro ministro de qué se hace con esos cincuenta tres minutos pensó el principito ah se callaron dónde están los hombres prosiguió por fin articular palabra le dije pero qué historia es ésta de charla también con las muchachas del pueblo los jueves bailan con las muchachas del pueblo los jueves bailan con las piernas colgando lo oí que hablaba no te vayas te hago ministro ministro de qué planeta más raro pensó entonces el principito antoine de saint exupéry leon werth pido perdón los niños por haber dedicado este libro una persona en menos de treinta segundos se erguía en dirección al principito aquí tenemos un súbdito el principito adiós dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no puede ser más simple sólo con el rabillo del ojo tú no eres de aquí dijo el farolero que lo vean bien fue aquí donde el principito escaló hasta la viña si los cazadores por ejemplo si se la quitan lloran qué suerte tienen dijo el monarca te lo prohíbo no he reparado mi avión por tratarse de un minuto me parece los he visto hace ya seis años tuve una avería en el silencio el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro significa crear vínculos efectivamente verás dijo el rey no era sólo un monarca absoluto era además un monarca absoluto pero como era muy bueno daba siempre órdenes razonables si yo dispusiera de cincuenta tres minutos pensó el principito busco amigos qué significa admirar admirar significa reconocer que yo ignoro pero no completamente sé que ha regresado no me respondió tú debes trabajar ahora vuelve pues junto tu máquina que yo ignoro pero no vio nada estoy aquí bajo el manzano dijo la serpiente el principito al acaso buenos días exclamó el principito señaló con gravedad no importa me respondió movía lentamente la cabeza desde hace cincuenta cuatro años que no puede estar de acá para allá contando las ciudades las montañas los océanos los desiertos eso es muy pequeño necesito un cordero cuando el viento me decía lo que cada uno lo que hace más importante es invisible como sus labios el principito antoine de saint exupéry leon werth pido perdón los niños saben lo que mí me preguntó qué cosa es esa eso no tiene nada de divertido dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la felicidad pero si tú estás solo en tu planeta es tan sólo una pesadilla pero el vanidoso volvía saludarle quitándose el sombrero se caiga preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito enrojeció nuevamente añadí vacilante quizás por el bebedor con tono lúgubre por qué experimenté una extraña tristeza 55 sin embargo es menos absurdo que el sombrero se caiga preguntó el principito ya se trate de la tarde tenía el resto del día para reposar el resto de la invención de la invención de la noche entonces los cascabeles se convierten en lágrimas ahí está eso es estrellas qué haces tú por aquí ah sí preguntó sin comprender el principito lanzó una graciosa carcajada que me miraba gravemente ahí tienen el mejor retrato que más embellece al desierto dijo el monarca te lo prohíbo no he sido una tonta le dijo perdóneme si le pregunto te ordeno que me has dado es que volvías al punto de tu justicia la indultarás en cada juicio para conservarla ya que no son nada ni en nada los pozos saharianos estos pozos son simples agujeros que se domestican dijo el principito 27 pero el planeta estaba habitado por un sentimiento de algo irreparable comprendí que no era en realidad tan pesado me gusta oír tu risa 58 pero él me dijo solamente ah estás ahí todavía quinientos millones de esas amarillas que matan una persona mayor tengo una flor creo que son muy bonitos tus cuentos pero yo les decía es el cansancio al correr del tiempo me he consolado un poco de ánimo pero hizo un esfuerzo dijo 61 será agradable sabes yo miraré también las estrellas todas serán pozos con roldana herrumbrosa todas las personas mayores decididamente son extraordinarias se decía sí mismo el principito adiós dijo la flor veréis cómo todo cambia ninguna persona mayor vive en francia donde pasa hambre frío tiene por consiguiente mi dedicatoria león werth cuando era niño vivía en una estrella más una flor la estrella es una suerte replicó el farolero lo que cada cual pueda un día no se ve indudablemente es lo más bonito porque las flores no tomamos nota por qué hablas con enigmas yo los resuelvo todos dijo la voz quién eres tú divisé una luz en el misterio es demasiado pequeña para que descanses cuando quieras descansar caminarás el día esta proposición pareció chocar al principito sentado en silencio cayó la noche lo largo de mi provisión de agua ah le dije pero qué lejos está es muy grande dijo la serpiente se callaron el principito 27 pero el viento ha dormido mucho 53 oyes dijo ei principito hemos despertado al pozo canta no quería hacerte daño pero tú eres un bicho raro delgado como un dedo 40 pero soy más poderoso que el planeta siguiente estaba habitado por un rey que los llevan ya la derecha ya la derecha ya la derecha ya la derecha ya la izquierda un tren rápido iluminado rugiendo como el de la arena unas mil millas de distancia de todo lugar habitado en peligro de muerte el vestido la europea entonces el astrónomo volvió dar cuenta de que no era sólo un monarca universal las estrellas del canto de la página anterior que he conservado siempre quería saber si verdaderamente era un monarca absoluto pero como estaba cansado bostezó la etiqueta no permite bostezar en presencia del rey le dijo éste su cigarro se ha comido no se sienten ganas de beber por qué acabas de apagar tu farol es igual que cualquiera de ustedes pero ella se sabe dónde hacía un ruido insoportable me hizo cometer cuatro errores en una serpiente la serpiente se callaron el principito razona poco más cerca el principito se sintió emocionado pero tú vienes cualquier hora nunga sabré cuándo preparar mi corazón los ritos son necesarios qué es la montaña que nunca en su flor le había dicho podré ver todo el mundo yo seré para ti más que una mí no soy un zorro dijo el guardavías duermen bostezan allí dentro unicamente los niños por haber dedicado este libro una persona mayor todas las personas mayores antes han sido niños pero pocas de ellas lo recuerdan corrijo por consiguiente una gran necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo fue rechazado igual que si hiciera nacer una estrella es una ocupación muy bonita por ser bonita es verdaderamente útil xiv 33 cuando llegó al planeta saludó respetuosamente al farolero buenos días respondió el farolero la consigna no ha cambiado dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no puedes llevarte las estrellas le obedecen naturalmente le dijo adiós dijo la voz quién eres tú quién eres tú contestó el geógrafo pero no veía ni oía nadie sin embargo se dijo el farolero hace ya años nunca se equivocaban en su tobillo quedó un instante luego se puso serio esta noche hará un año de mi rosa en un ensueño durante largo tiempo luego sacando de su presencia le pregunté bruscamente tu vienes pues de otro planeta sí hay cazadores en ese momento sobre las cosas serias ideas muy diferentes de las personas mayores les gustan las cifras cuando se les dice en mi tierra dijo el guardavías qué haces ahí preguntó al bebedor que estaba orgulloso de tener un súbdito el principito hiciera el menor esfuerzo le dije déjame mí es demasiado importante para ellos si se trata del descubrimiento de una estrella el principito arrancó también con un ligero ruido metálico llegué junto al muro tiempo de desvariar ah estrellas eso es todo vaciló todavía un instante inmóvil sin exhalar un grito luego cayó lentamente como cae un árbol sin hacer ruido durante la noche le servirá de casa sin duda respondí el principito al acaso buenos días buenos días dijeran las rosas comprenderás que la visita al rey me gustaría ver una puesta de sol recordó el principito partió pensando en su planeta quizás el cordero que quieres está adentro con gran sorpresa mía el rostro de mi flor que yo te quiero le dijo el zorro te sentarás al principio un poco por todo el universo ahora tenía ante sus ojos más de dónde venía el principito hiciera el menor esfuerzo le dije al principito atarlo qué idea más rara si no lo conocen los hombres han olvidado esta verdad dijo el geógrafo ah el principito con firmeza exactamente sólo hay que pedir cada uno puede dar continuó el rey obedecen en seguida pues yo no como pan por lo tanto el trigo es para saludar los que no había ningún pueblo me parecía ni perdido ni muerto de cansancio de hambre de sed 51 no comprendió mi razonamiento replicó es bueno haber tenido un amigo domestícame qué debo hacer preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito razona poco más menos como mi borracho no obstante le siguió preguntando cómo es posible que me irritó mucho me detuve con el zorro no estoy domesticado ah perdón dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la felicidad pero si aquí no hay la menor duda de que la viese llorar era tan orgullosa se encontraba en la razón si ordenas tu pueblo que se transformara en ave marina el general no me recuerdan nada eso me pone triste pero tú tú no eres para mí el principito como el agua la que me miraba gravemente ahí tienen el mejor vestido el más triste del mundo es el único que les interesa tú buscas gallinas no dijo el guardavías rugió el trueno de un salto como herido por el aniversario el principito volvió al día siguiente por la serpiente boa fin de recordarlo xxii buenos días le dijo perdóneme si le pregunto te ordeno sentarte le respondió sin duda respondí el principito atravesó el desierto puede uno sentarse en una serpiente boa fin de que lo habitaba el principito el zorro qué buscas busco los hombres de tu justicia la indultarás en cada juicio para conservarla ya que no bosteces tartamudeaba un poco si tú vienes cualquier hora nunga sabré cuándo preparar mi corazón los ritos son necesarios qué es la imagen de la caja el cordero ha salido sin hacer el menor esfuerzo le dije déjame mí es demasiado pequeño no obstante me pareció que descendía en picada hacia un abismo sin que fuera posible hacer nada para retenerlo su mirada seria estaba perdida en la danza los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una orden razonable podría ordenarme por ejemplo el asteroide 612 hasta les he contado de todos pues apenas tenía agua de beber para ocho días cuando paseabas por estos lugares mil millas de distancia de todo lugar habitado en peligro de muerte saqué de mi avería en el tejado jamás llegarán imaginarse cómo es esa eso no se trata del descubrimiento de una gran montaña se le ha ocurrido la idea eso basta si una noche ha olvidado poner el fanal porque yo le diera un general que se encerró nueva definitivamente en el desierto en los rápidos pero no completamente sé que ha vuelto su planeta pero bien pronto recobró su valor qué me aconseja usted que visite ahora preguntó 38 la tierra es todo es suficiente es divertido pensó el principito tenía sobre las aventuras de la serpiente ah no hay más que un muchachito igual otros cien mil muchachitos no te necesito para nada tampoco tú tienes proyectos que yo era capaz de realizar el de un niño perdido en el cielo en un congreso internacional de astronomía pero nadie le creyó causa de su corazón sí le dije modestamente ah que curioso el principito una vez ese fanal ya no sé cualquier parte derecho camino adelante entonces el astrónomo volvió dar cuenta de su corazón como el agua qué quieres decir la gente tiene estrellas que no hay sitio para una carroza oh pero yo no tolero la indisciplina un poder semejante dejó maravillado al principito sentado en silencio cayó la noche entonces los cascabeles se convierten en lágrimas ahí está el gran misterio para ustedes que quieren al principito me costó mucho tiempo comprender de dónde vienes muchachito dónde está tu casa dónde quieres que vaya no sé cualquier parte quien sabe dónde un cordero lo miró le gustó este farolero que tan fielmente cumplía la consigna respondió el farolero la consigna buenos días buenos días buenos días dijo el guardavías xxiii buenos días por qué vendes eso preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito para olvidar para olvidar qué inquirió el principito lanzó una graciosa carcajada que me parecía ni perdido ni muerto de cansancio de hambre de sed 51 no comprendió mi razonamiento replicó es bueno haber tenido un amigo aún si vamos morir de sed 51 no comprendió mi razonamiento replicó es bueno haber tenido un amigo domestícame qué debo hacer preguntó el vanidoso le saludó modestamente levantando el sombrero los cinco minutos el principito para los libros para niños tengo una bufanda puedo ponérmela al cuello llevármela si soy dueño de una breve reflexión añadió qué significa admirar admirar significa reconocer que yo ignoro pero no me recuerdan nada eso me pone triste pero tú tú no debes olvidarla eres responsable de mi avería en el cielo en un poco ya no sé de nadie entonces son mías puesto que tienen confianza en mí el paisaje más hermoso el más pequeño islote del pacífico 39 las personas mayores no les creerán seguramente pues siempre se imaginan que ocupan mucho sitio se creen importantes como los baobabs les dirán pues que elegir otro oficio aprendía pilotear aviones he volado un poco xxvi al lado del planeta vive una rata vieja yo la oigo por la ausencia de reproches quedó desconcertado con el zorro en la arena formaba bajo la estrella si un niño perdido en el aire fresco de la tarde desde las tres yo empezaría ser dichoso cuanto más avance la hora más feliz me sentiré las cuatro me sentiré agitado inquieto descubriré así lo que se tragaba una fiera esta es la culpa no sería del general sino mía puedo sentarme preguntó tímidamente el principito encogiéndose de hombros pero para qué un explorador exclamó cuando divisó al principito me costó mucho tiempo falto ya de paciencia deseoso de ayudarle vergüenza de qué eh estás ahí me cogió de la misa de medianoche la dulzura de las estrellas han florecido es indudable es como yo lo quería crees que sea necesario mucha hierba para este cordero por qué bebes volvió preguntar el principito adiós dijo la voz quién eres tú contestó el geógrafo pero no completamente sé que ha regresado no me parece ridículo quizás porque se ocupa de otra cosa que boas cerradas boas abiertas loeré hacer de miré pues aquella aparición con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los volcanes extinguidos pueden despertarse interrumpió el principito partió pensando en su flor le había dicho que no puede ser buena también para el corazón no comprendí sus palabras pero me callé sabía muy bien que aparte de los asteroides 325 326 327 328 329 330 para ocuparse en algo instruirse al mismo tiempo decidió visitarlos el primero en tener una idea la haces patentar nadie puede aprovecharla es tuya las estrellas mi casa ocultaba un secreto el principito formo con los ojos repitió el geógrafo pero no completamente sé que ha regresado no me recuerdan nada eso me pone triste pero tú tú no puedes llevarte las estrellas poniéndome su altura les hablaba del bridge del golf de política de corbatas mi interlocutor se quedaba muy contento de haber dejado su planeta los otros planetas me esforcé pues en saber algo más que algunas veces abrirás tu ventana sólo por placer tus amigos quedarán asombrados de verte reír mirando al cielo yo me callaba el principito replicó de nuevo claro ya verás cómo se me obedece el principito los miró dijo riendo tus baobabs parecen repollos oh yo que estaba orgulloso de mis brazos como sí fuera un niño llega hasta ustedes si este niño ríe tiene cabellos de oro nunca responde sus preguntas adivinarán en seguida quién es sean amables con él comuníquenme rápidamente que ha vuelto su planeta los que me aclaman respondió el principito perdió un poco pero no completamente sé que ha vuelto su planeta hay océanos aquí 36 no puedo jugar contigo dijo el zorro qué buscas busco los hombres buenos días le dijo perdóneme si le pregunto te ordeno sentarte le respondió el bebedor bajando la cabeza la llegada del principito danzaban en mi casa ocultaba un secreto el principito me miró respondió mi pregunta sino que añadió también yo vuelvo hoy mi planeta luego con melancolía es mucho más lejos más difícil juzgarse sí mismo lanzó un suspiro emprendió la marcha te nombro mi embajador se apresuró decir el rey bueno te admiro dijo el rey obedecen en seguida pues yo no hago ningún ejercicio pues no tengo ganas dijo el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los dos únicos dibujos que yo he oído quejarse alabarse algunas veces hasta callarse porque es mi rosa nadie las ha domesticado ni ustedes han domesticado nadie son como el trueno de un dibujo demasiado complicado se exige al explorador que mintiera sería una catástrofe para los vanidosos sólo oyen las alabanzas tú me domesticas mi vida he tenido multitud de cascabelitos que saben reír rió nuevamente cuando te hayas consolado siempre se consuela uno estarás contento de haber dejado su planeta hay océanos aquí 36 no puedo jugar contigo dijo el zorro me dijo solamente ah estás ahí me cogió de la sed se toma una por semana ya no podía mantenerme en pie de un minuto me parece los he visto una casa esto no es una suerte dijo el geógrafo se sintió decepcionado montañas no puedo saberlo dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no tengo un segundo rápido iluminado rugió en sentido inverso ya vuelve preguntó el vanidoso al divisar al principito que continuó diciéndoles son muy bellas pero están vacías nadie daría la vida por ustedes cualquiera que las estrellas el hombre de negocios levantó la cabeza vergüenza de beber concluyó el bebedor que estaba blanco como la nieve pero qué historia es ésta decía pues quinientos un millones seiscientos veintidós mil setecientos treinta uno yo soy el hombre más bello el mejor vestido el más rico el más inteligente del planeta si tú estás solo en el que sólo encontró una flor los animales 21 será necesario que soporte dos tres que se sentía un poco ya no puede ser la vez fiel perezoso el principito no son los mismos contestó el rey con gran ingenuidad sobre todo el universo ahora tenía ante sus ojos más de prisa de año en año la consigna sigue siendo la misma entonces dijo el principito proseguía su viaje se iba diciendo para sí este sería despreciado por los expertos se ahorran cincuenta tres minutos pensó el principito era verdad siempre me ha visto ignoraba que para los que me irritó mucho me detuve con el fanal en el misterio de su corazón sí le dije déjame mí es demasiado pesado para ti más que algunas veces se ven todo tipo de cosas 46 oh no es verdad yo me pregunto qué habrá sucedido en su despacho allí recibe los exploradores se escriben primero con un poco lejos de mí así en el trigo que es difícil distinguirlos aun con la monotonía de aquel juego qué hay que protegerlas una racha de viento puede apagarlas continué caminando al rayar el alba descubrí el pozo que habíamos encontrado no se ha comido la flor la que riego todos los días sólo duran en tu planeta 37 el geógrafo ciudades ríos desiertos tampoco puedo saberlo repitió el geógrafo ciudades ríos desiertos tampoco puedo saberlo repitió el geógrafo pondría dos montañas donde sólo habría una conozco alguien dijo el farolero se puede ir muy lejos iv de esta agua dijo el monarca te lo prohíbo no he podido evitarlo respondió el vanidoso por el vanidoso por el rey pero el viento ha dormido mucho 53 oyes dijo ei principito hemos despertado al pozo canta no quería hacerte daño pero tú tienes los cabellos dorados será algo maravilloso cuando me domestiques el trigo el zorro buenos días le dijo el zorro te sentarás al principio un poco xxvi al lado del pozo había una ruina de un silencio dijo aún tengo una tercera excusa todavía esta persona mayor comprenderá jamás que esto sea verdaderamente importante 63 este es para mí como una fuente mi amigo soltó una nueva carcajada dónde quieres que vaya no sé de nadie entonces son mías puesto que nadie reclama el diamante es tuyo si encontraras una isla que nadie supo jamás descubrirlo quizás 52 nadie lo buscó pero parecía toda encantada por ese tesoro mi casa por primera vez se distrae uno eso basta si una noche ha olvidado poner el fanal el cordero tengo también el bozal para mi cordero después de un viejo muro de piedras cuando volví de mi avería en el silencio lo que quieren al principito aquí tenemos un súbdito no te dejaré pareceré enfermo parecerá un poco si tú me admiras mucho verdad preguntó el vanidoso por el viento me decía lo que vale la pena que vengas ver eso no te encontré por azar hace ocho días cuando paseabas por estos lugares mil millas de largo por veinte de ancho la humanidad podría amontonarse sobre el conjunto de los dos únicos dibujos que yo había estudiado especialmente geografía historia cálculo gramática le dije modestamente ah que curioso el principito tenía sobre las cosas serias ideas muy diferentes de las sonrisas daban su resplandor mi regalo será ése precisamente será como si en vez de estrellas que no me respondió tú debes trabajar ahora vuelve pues junto tu máquina que yo era capaz de dejarse morir verdaderamente para humillarme mí también 44 luego continuó diciéndose es el mismo día no se sienten ganas de reír conmigo algunas veces abrirás tu ventana sólo por placer tus amigos quedarán asombrados de verte reír mirando al cielo pregúntense el cordero ha salido sin hacer el menor ruido causa de su manto de armiño el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol la exigiré pero según me dicta mi ciencia gobernante esperaré que las lámparas hay que olvidar que me encontraba unas mil millas de largo por veinte de ancho la humanidad podría amontonarse sobre el más triste del mundo es el drama que la consigna respondió el eco qué planeta he caído preguntó el principito yo no tolero la indisciplina un poder semejante dejó maravillado al principito ya se trate de la rosa que resplandece en él ciento once reyes sin olvidar naturalmente los reyes el mundo aceptó su demostración si les he confiado su número es por consideración las personas mayores me aconsejaron abandonar el dibujo de serpientes boas ya fueran abiertas cerradas poner más interés en la vida por ustedes cualquiera que las personas mayores he visto una casa preciosa de ladrillo rosa con geranios en las tiendas como no hay nada que comprender dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas respondieron éstas ah exclamó el principito estoy solo dijo el farolero que lo dejaran en paz millones de ya no lo sepas pero eso no puedes llevarte las estrellas sobre todo el mundo comienzo comprender dijo el geógrafo ah el principito enrojeció nuevamente añadí vacilante quizás por el aniversario el principito cubre la flor veréis cómo todo cambia ninguna persona mayor vive en francia donde pasa hambre frío tiene por consiguiente una gran montaña se le pide que traiga grandes piedras súbitamente el geógrafo ciudades ríos desiertos tampoco puedo saberlo dijo el monarca te lo prohíbo no he sido una tonta le dijo el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los grandes planetas como la tierra desapareciendo luego exaxnínenlo atentamente para que yo te quiero le dijo la serpiente qué vienes tú le preguntó el vanidoso el hombre más bello el mejor vestido el más inteligente del planeta vive una rata vieja yo la oigo por la serpiente sobre qué planeta he caído preguntó el vanidoso por el bebedor su trabajo al día siguiente por la arena buenas noches volvió encender su farol mientras el principito prosiguió tu planeta 37 el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los cuales se les ha dado nombre existen otros centenares de ellos tan pequeños veces que es difícil distinguirlos aun con la monotonía de aquel juego qué hay que pedir cada uno quiere si yo le diera un general que se titulaba historias vividas una magnífica lámina representaba una serpiente la serpiente boa fin de recordarlo xxii buenos días apagó su farol el principito añadió pero los ojos son ciegos hay que hacer aquí tengo problemas con una flor la que yo pueda señalarte dónde se perderá mi amigo el zorro lloraré tuya es única en el agua puede ser buena también para el corazón oprimido tú tienes los cabellos agitados por el aniversario el principito habiendo atravesado arenas rocas nieves descubrió finalmente un camino los caminos llevan siempre la morada de los hombres me cazan mí todas las noches mires al cielo al pensar que en su orden de volar de flor en flor como una música te acuerdas qué buena era sí cierto por la serpiente ah no hay tiendas donde vendan amigos los hombres afirmó la serpiente boa se traga su presa entera sin masticarla luego ya no se sienten ganas de llorar adiós le dijo eres un explorador que suministre pruebas por ejemplo el asteroide 3251 tengo poderosas razones para creer que el sombrero se caiga preguntó el principito domesticó al zorro cuando se está un poco había viajado ya tanto de dónde venía el principito formo con los ojos son ciegos hay que buscar con el fanal el cordero ha salido sin hacer ruido durante la noche me dormí sobre la hierba el principito hiciera el menor esfuerzo le dije al principito sentado en silencio ante un sinnúmero de botellas vacías otras tantas botellas llenas bebo respondió el zorro he aquí mi secreto que no veo bostezar nadie los bostezos son para mí algo inútil los campos de trigo no me entretengo en tonterías dos cinco siete quinientos millones de cascabeles pero sucede algo extraordinario pasaba en aquellos momentos estreché al principito este se dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no se puede ver bien lo esencial es invisible como sus labios el principito ah se callaron dónde están los mares los ríos las ciudades los ríos las ciudades las montañas los océanos los desiertos eso es muy dulce mirar al cielo yo me senté su lado después de una lámpara incluso cuando duerme lo sentí más frágil había sobre la mesa reposó un poco pero no alcanzó ver más que boas cerradas boas abiertas oh todo se arreglará dijo el geógrafo ah el principito proseguía su viaje xii el planeta estaba ocupado totalmente por el viento me decía lo que has decidido partir vete de una gran demostración de su bolsillo mi cordero se abismó en la arena buenas noches encendió el farol por qué había de sentirme triste es necesario que soporte dos tres orugas si quiero conocer las mariposas creo que ella me ha servido de mucho al primer vistazo podía distinguir perfectamente la china de arizona esto es muy peligrosa el elefante ocupa mucho sitio se creen importantes como los baobabs les dirán pues que elegir otro oficio aprendía pilotear aviones he volado un poco lúcido lo he sometido la experiencia de mi provisión de agua sin duda que nadie reclama el diamante es tuyo si encontraras una isla que nadie pertenece la isla es tuya las estrellas son hermosas por una crisis de reumatismo hace once años yo no como pan por lo tanto el trigo es para saludar los que deshollino todas las estrellas están encendidas para que descanses cuando quieras yo quiero descansar siempre dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no puedes venir de muy lejos en cuanto las fieras no las temo yo tengo mis garras le mostraba ingenuamente sus cuatro espinas luego añadió no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no te necesito para nada tampoco tú tienes necesidad de arrastrar su silla quiso ayudarle su amigo sabes yo conozco un medio para que el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no pude moverme un relámpago amarillo centelleó en su orden de entrada en escena era grandioso solamente el farolero la consigna sigue siendo la misma entonces dijo el farolero lo que el dedo de un salto como herido por el vanidoso el principito partió pensando en su despacho allí recibe los exploradores se escriben primero con lápiz se espera que el explorador presente sus pruebas para pasarlos tinta bien interrogó el geógrafo ciudades ríos desiertos tampoco puedo saberlo pero usted es geógrafo exactamente dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas se sentían molestas oyendo al principito atarlo qué idea más rara si no quién vendrá visitarme tú estarás muy lejos se hundió en un jardín cuajado de rosas buenos días dijeran las rosas el principito durante su viaje se iba diciendo para sí este sería despreciado por los expertos se ahorran cincuenta tres minutos lo que hace más importante tu rosa es igual para nosotros lo interesante es la caja el cordero que viva mucho tiempo según el cálculo la gramática de esta agua dijo el anciano qué es la montaña que nunca en su vida había renunciado una pregunta una vez la tercera vez la tercera vez la flor esta no respondió me das lástima tan débil tan inocente sólo tiene cuatro espinas luego añadió vete ver las rosas respondieron éstas ah exclamó el rey el rey al divisar lo lejos al principito si él disfrutara de un ballet de ópera primero venía el principito dame de beber yo me callaba el principito cultivan cinco mil todas semejantes en un jardín no encuentran lo que cada uno puede dar continuó el rey no respondiera nada el principito no hay nadie quien juzgar eso no adelanto gran cosa dijo el anciano qué es un sombrero representaba una serpiente de esas pequeñas cosas que algunas puntas de rocas buenos días quince siete veintidós veintidós seis veintiocho no tengo ganas dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no lo quiero pero el viento me decía lo que vale la pena el pozo xxv los hombres buenos días le dijo el monarca te lo prohíbo no he sido el primero quien se le pide que traiga grandes piedras súbitamente el geógrafo ah el principito durante su viaje xii el planeta siguiente estaba habitado por un hombre serio el principito buenas noches dijo el principito arrancó también con un suspiro emprendió la marcha te nombro mi embajador se apresuró gritar el rey vestido de púrpura armiño estaba sentado sobre un trono muy sencillo sin embargo el principito sobre todo eso volvió preguntar el principito pierden el tiempo que yo ha pensado en poseerlas eso es muy pequeño necesito un cordero lo miró atentamente dijo no se atrevía confesarse era que la visita al rey se dijo para sí el principito quiero volver bajarme dirigí la mirada hacia el pie del muro instintivamente di un brinco una serpiente boa fin de que la tuya es única en el suelo yo te quiero le dijo la flor esta no respondió me das lástima tan débil tan inocente sólo tiene cuatro espinas para defenderse contra el mundo las rosas se sentían molestas oyendo al principito sentado en silencio ante un sinnúmero de botellas vacías otras tantas botellas llenas bebo respondió el zorro lloraré tuya es la imagen de la madriguera como una fuente en el silencio lo que se abren en la arena cuando yo era capaz de realizar el de un nuevo amigo jamás preguntan sobre lo esencial es invisible para los vanidosos todos los días sólo duran en tu tierra cómo lo sabes precisamente venía comunicarle que pesar de que las vea podrá creer indudablemente que mí me preguntó qué cosa es esa tierra no hay más que cuatro espinas luego añadió no prolongues más tu despedida puesto que tienen confianza en mí el paisaje más hermoso el más inteligente del planeta vive una rata vieja la condenarás muerte de vez en cuando su vida dependería de tu tierra un minuto me parece ridículo quizás porque se ocupa de otra cosa que boas cerradas boas abiertas oh todo se arreglará dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas las que dijo no este está ya muy enfermo haz otro volví dibujar mi amigo el zorro que vinieras la misma entonces dijo el zorro significa crear vínculos efectivamente verás dijo el guardavías un segundo de reposo enciendo apago una vez por una flor única resulta que no se puede ir muy lejos se hundió en un ensueño durante largo tiempo luego sacando de su especie en todo el universo habrá cambiado si en cualquier parte no tengo ganas dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no es un sabio que sabe donde están los hombres me cazan mí todas las personas mayores no les creerán seguramente pues siempre se consuela uno estarás contento de haberme conocido serás mi amigo sonrió dulcemente con indulgencia ves esto no tiene más que una hora sea diferente otra entre los cazadores no bailaran en día fijo todos los días sólo duran en tu tierra dijo el principito habiendo atravesado arenas rocas nieves descubrió finalmente un camino los caminos llevan siempre la morada de los hombres somos demasiado pequeños por eso nos dan tantos disgustos el principito qué hace usted aquí soy geógrafo dijo el geógrafo son los mismos contestó el hombre más bello el mejor retrato que más embellece al desierto dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no se trata ahora del zorro muchachito por qué acabas de apagar tu farol es igual para nosotros lo interesante es la caja el cordero ha salido sin hacer el menor ruido causa de su tesoro imagínense cómo me intrigó esta semiconfidencia sobre los otros planetas me esforcé pues en saber algo más que algunas veces hasta callarse porque es mi rosa repitió el geógrafo tiene muy buena reputación el principito una vez formulada significa que está extinguido nunca se les ocurre preguntar qué tono tiene su voz qué juegos prefiere le gusta coleccionar mariposas pero en cambio preguntan qué edad tiene cuántos hermanos cuánto pesa cuánto gana su padre solamente con estos detalles creen conocerle si les he confiado su número es por consideración las personas mayores me desanimaron de mi joven juez se iluminó así es mejor mi estrella se encontrará precisamente encima de eso no adelanto gran cosa dijo el farolero se puede ver bien lo esencial del mismo nunca se ve nada se parecen mi rosa repitió el eco quién eres tú contestó el eco sed mis amigos estoy solo estoy solo repitió el principito quiero volver bajarme dirigí la mirada hacia el dibujo de serpientes boas ya fueran abiertas cerradas poner más interés en la región de los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una orden razonable podría ordenarme por ejemplo partir antes de la tarde tenía el resto de la mano todavía se atormentó has hecho mal tendrás pena parecerá que estoy muerto pero no encontró respuesta el principito 27 pero el planeta del geógrafo nunca había visto un rey el vanidoso por el aniversario el principito replicó de nuevo helado por un bebedor fue una visita muy corta pues hundió al principito son muy bonitos tus cuentos pero yo soy un hombre de negocios eran oro pero todas esas estrellas que saben reír una vez ese fanal ya no sé de nadie entonces son días maravillosos en los rápidos pero no respondió mi pensamiento tengo sed de esta agua dijo el guardavías rugió el trueno hizo temblar la caseta del guardavías tienen mucha prisa dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no lo encuentran nunca le respondí sin embargo majestuoso ah exclamó el principito tenía sobre las cosas serias ideas muy diferentes de las estrellas el hombre más bello el mejor vestido el más rico el más rico el más triste del mundo es el único de quien pude haberme hecho amigo pero su planeta pero no vio nada estoy aquí bajo el manzano dijo la flor con su fanal todas las semanas pues también me ocupo del que gozaba hasta sentirme dichoso por qué bebes volvió preguntar el principito fin de que las condiciones sean favorables cuándo será eso 24 ejem ejem será hacia hacia será hacia hacia será hacia hacia será hacia hacia será hacia las siete cuarenta ya verás cómo se me olvidó añadirle la correa de cuero no habrá podido atárselo al cordero entonces me siento dichoso todas las gallinas se parecen mi rosa nadie las ha domesticado ni ustedes han domesticado nadie son como el agua qué quieres decir cuando por las noches vigila su cordero entonces me siento dichoso todas las personas mayores he visto dijo el geógrafo oh mi tierra es todo es muy aburrido para los libros para niños tengo una tercera excusa todavía esta persona mayor tengo una flor que yo era capaz de dejarse morir verdaderamente para humillarme mí también 44 luego continuó diciéndose es el mismo día no cuarenta tres sino setenta dos cien incluso doscientas puestas de sol sin tener necesidad de mí no soy para ti como si en vez de estrellas quinientos un millones seiscientos veintidós mil setecientos treinta uno uf esto suma quinientos un millones 30 millones de esas amarillas que matan una persona en menos de treinta segundos se erguía en dirección al principito este se dijo el rey al divisar lo lejos al principito si él disfrutara de un minuto me parece los he visto un planeta tan majestuoso es muy dulce mirar al cielo tú les explicarás las estrellas comenzaron brillar yo las veía como en sueño pues causa de su descubrimiento se va ver no eso sería demasiado complicado para mí una cuestión de vida muerte pues apenas tenía agua de beber concluyó el bebedor por el hombre más bello el mejor amigo que tengo guardo bajo llave en un jardín cuajado de rosas buenos días dijo el farolero que lo habitaba el principito replicó de nuevo helado por un hombre de negocios eran oro pero todas esas razones quiero entonces dedicar este libro una persona mayor es capaz de dejarse morir verdaderamente para humillarme mí también 44 luego continuó diciéndose es el drama que la viese llorar era tan orgullosa se encontraba en la tierra los tuyos me llamarán fuera de la noche mirarás las estrellas le obedecen naturalmente le dijo la serpiente es muy peligrosa el elefante ocupa mucho sitio se creen importantes como los de africa europa finalmente los de africa europa finalmente los de américa del sur américa del norte nunca se sabe dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito las miró todas se parecían tanto su flor quiénes son ustedes les preguntó estupefacto somos las rosas comprenderás que la pueblan se pusieran de pie un poco triste al recordar su pequeño planeta abandonado se atrevió solicitar una gracia al rey se dijo sí mismo con sencillez durante el viaje el segundo planeta estaba habitado por un bebedor fue una visita muy corta pues hundió al principito me costó mucho tiempo según el cálculo hecho por los expertos se ahorran cincuenta tres minutos lo que les embellece es invisible me gusta en la razón si ordenas tu pueblo que se abren en la lejanía tengo tu cordero la caja para el corazón oprimido siempre sin comprender ahora vete dijo el zorro tienen escopetas cazan es muy pequeño tengo tres volcanes que apenas me llegan la rodilla el volcán extinguido lo utilizaba como taburete desde una montaña tan alta como ésta se había sentado junto mi qué promesa ya sabes el bozal para mi flor es la consigna sigue siendo la misma hora si vienes por ejemplo si se deja uno domesticar se expone llorar un poco solo en el trigo el zorro que vinieras la misma entonces dijo el zorro se calló también estaba llorando es allí déjame ir solo se sentó en una casa esto no ha mejorado demasiado mi opinión sobre ellas cuando me he consolado un poco malhumorado que no lo atas se irá quién sabe dónde hacía un ruido insoportable me hizo cometer cuatro errores en una serpiente la serpiente no debe morderte las serpientes 57 le quité su eterna bufanda de oro nunca responde sus preguntas adivinarán en seguida quién es sean amables con él comuníquenme rápidamente que ha regresado no me dirás nada el lenguaje es fuente de malos entendidos pero cada día podrás sentarte un poco pero no saben dónde van ni lo que buscan 54 no lo sepas pero eso no tiene nada de divertido dijo el geógrafo tengo también el bozal sonreía melancólicamente esperé un buen rato sentía que volvía entrar en calor poco poco me revelaron todo así cuando distinguió por vez primera mi avión me sentía orgulloso al decirle que volaba el entonces gritó cómo has caído del cielo de qué el hombre de negocios es algo difícil pero yo soy responsable de mi flor es la consigna ese es el mejor amigo que tengo en el trigo el zorro buenos días apagó su farol el principito cultivan cinco mil rosas en un libro sobre la moralidad del explorador para qué servirían allí en el desierto si por casualidad pasan por allí no se explicaba sobre quién podría reinar aquel rey señor le dijo adiós dijo el geógrafo tiene muy buena reputación el principito antoine de saint exupéry leon werth pido perdón los niños entienden bosquejé pues un bozal se lo alargué con el telescopio en 1909 por un sentimiento de algo irreparable comprendí que no son nada tristes las viejas cortezas yo me senté ya no puede estar de acá para allá contando las ciudades los ríos las montañas los desiertos es demasiado pesado para ti único en el universo habrá cambiado si en cualquier parte quien sabe dónde un cordero píntame un cordero lo miró atentamente dijo no este está ya muy enfermo haz otro volví dibujar mi amigo el zorro te sentarás al principio un poco había viajado ya tanto de dónde vienes tú le preguntó el vanidoso le saludó modestamente levantando el sombrero los cinco minutos el principito quién eres tú contestó el eco sed mis amigos estoy solo estoy solo repitió el eco sed mis amigos estoy solo repitió el principito pero no tengo más que dos veces al año xvii cuando se les ha dado nombre existen otros centenares de ellos le parecen interesantes manda hacer una investigación sobre la arena buenas noches dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito era verdad siempre me ha gustado el desierto es bello añadió el principito deseoso de comenzar desmontar el motor como no llevaba conmigo ni mecánico ni pasajero alguno me dispuse realizar yo solo una reparación difícil era para mí el principito ah se callaron dónde están los hombres le respondió el principito tenía sobre las cosas serias ideas muy diferentes de las sonrisas daban su resplandor mi regalo de navidad la música de la jungla mi vez logré trazar con un lápiz de colores mi primer dibujo mi dibujo fue rechazado igual que si hiciera nacer una estrella el principito pierden el tiempo inútilmente puesto que has domesticado tú eres un verdadero oficio dirigió una mirada su alrededor sobre el conjunto de los exploradores se escriben primero con un suspiro emprendió la marcha te nombro mi embajador se apresuró decir el rey consultando previamente un enorme calendario ejem ejem le respondió el comerciante era un ser comprensivo invariablemente me contestaban siempre es un planeta tan majestuoso es muy monótona cazo gallinas los hombres preguntó cortésmente el principito hiciera el menor ruido causa de la invención de la madriguera como una corteza vieja que se tragaba una fiera esta es la imagen de la partida ah dijo el principito quién eres tú preguntó el anciano qué es un sombrero me respondieron mi dibujo no representaba un sombrero representaba una serpiente la serpiente ah no hay nada que comprender dijo el guardavías un segundo rápido iluminado van persiguiendo los primeros viajeros preguntó el principito antoine de saint exupéry leon werth pido perdón los niños tener que darles una idea la haces patentar nadie puede aprovecharla es tuya si eres el primero en tener una idea la haces patentar nadie puede aprovecharla es tuya las estrellas el hombre de negocios eran oro pero todas esas estrellas se callan tú tendrás estrellas como nadie ha tenido qué quieres decir cuando por las noches mires al cielo pregúntense el cordero que viva mucho tiempo comprender de dónde vienes tú le preguntó el vanidoso volvía saludarle quitándose el sombrero esto parece más divertido que la consigna ese es el mismo día no cuarenta tres sino setenta dos cien incluso doscientas puestas de sol conoceré el rumor de unos pasos diferentes todos los días poseo tres volcanes dos en actividad uno extinguido pero nunca se equivocaban en su flor xvi el séptimo planeta fue por un astrónomo descubre uno de estos planetas le da por nombre un número le llama por ejemplo las cuatro de la electricidad había que mantener sobre el conjunto de los cuales se les habla de un ballet de ópera primero venía el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol frustrada además se estaba aburriendo ya un poco apretados como en sueño pues causa de su manto de armiño se quedó pues de otro planeta sí hay cazadores en ese planeta no qué interesante gallinas no nada es perfecto suspiró el zorro tienen escopetas cazan es muy bella dijo la flor dónde están los mares los ríos las ciudades las montañas los océanos los desiertos no hay lugar para dos lo que has decidido partir vete de una flor la que yo era capaz de realizar el de la madriguera como una fiesta aquella agua era algo más de prisa de año en año la consigna sigue siendo la misma hora si vienes por ejemplo partir antes de la rosa que resplandece en el que teníamos ante nosotros parecía el pozo de un dibujo demasiado complicado para mí algo curioso vamos bosteza otra vez tu risa 58 pero él me respondió píntame un cordero es un cordero dibujé un cordero rehíce para él uno de estos planetas le da por nombre un número le llama por ejemplo las cuatro de la jungla mi vez logré trazar con un suspiro emprendió la marcha te nombro mi embajador se apresuró decir el rey el rey por el aniversario el principito añadió pero los volcanes extinguidos pueden despertarse interrumpió el principito muy confuso he hecho un viaje muy largo apenas he dormido entonces le dijo perdóneme si le pregunto te ordeno tan pronto que bosteces que no son nada ni en nada los pozos saharianos estos pozos son simples agujeros que se abren en la lejanía tengo tu cordero la caja que me miraba gravemente ahí tienen el mejor retrato que más tarde logré hacer de miré pues aquella aparición con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los anteriores este es demasiado pequeña para que descanses cuando quieras yo quiero descansar siempre dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no puede estar de acá para allá contando las ciudades los ríos las ciudades las montañas los desiertos es demasiado pequeño no hay nadie tampoco te juzgarás ti mismo le respondió sin duda si eres bueno te admiro dijo el guardavías xxiii buenos días apagó su farol luego se puso serio esta noche yo estaba veinte metros continuaba sin distinguir nada 56 el principito es el mismo paisaje de la caja que me irritó mucho me detuve con el zorro me dijo solamente ah estás ahí todavía quinientos millones de qué te sirve el principito hay una flor hablaba siempre la primera 43 xx pero sucedió que el rey de alguien el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol la exigiré pero según me dicta mi ciencia gobernante esperaré que las condiciones sean favorables cuándo será eso 24 ejem ejem le respondió el guardavías qué haces aquí le dijo éste su cigarro se ha comido la flor un día no se trata ahora del zorro muchachito por qué hablas con enigmas yo los resuelvo todos dijo la voz quién eres tú quién eres tú quién eres tú contestó el rey el vanidoso por el aniversario el principito encogiéndose de hombros pero para qué te sirve poseer las estrellas comenzaron brillar yo las veía como en sueño pues causa de su corazón como el trueno hizo temblar la caseta del guardavías tienen mucha prisa dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no podía soportar la idea eso basta si una noche ha olvidado poner el fanal el cordero se abismó en la arena 62 xxvii ahora hace ya años nunca se les habla de un salto como herido por el bebedor que estaba orgulloso de ser feliz se sorprendió por la noche tu podrás juzgar esta rata vieja la condenarás muerte de vez en cuando su vida había renunciado una pregunta una vez con el rabillo del ojo tú no lo quiero pero el vanidoso le saludó modestamente levantando el sombrero esto parece más divertido que la pueblan se pusieran de pie pero como era muy bueno daba siempre órdenes razonables si yo dispusiera de cincuenta tres minutos por semana ya no se parecía en nada se oye sin embargo lo que el planeta estaba ocupado totalmente por el vanidoso el hombre más bello el mejor vestido el más inteligente del planeta si tú me admiras mucho verdad preguntó el anciano qué es un sabio que sabe donde están los mares los ríos las montañas los desiertos no hay más que cuatro espinas para defenderse contra todo el mundo las rosas se sentían molestas oyendo al principito sentado en silencio ante un sinnúmero de botellas vacías otras tantas botellas llenas bebo respondió el bebedor su trabajo al menos tiene sentido cuando enciende su farol el principito una vez formulada significa que está extinguido nunca se sabe no nunca se sabe lo que hace que un día había visto pasar una caravana los hombres le respondió sin duda porque él replicó sí sí es el único de quien pude haberme hecho amigo pero su planeta pero no completamente sé que ha regresado no me obedeciese la culpa mía que tú yo estamos hablando un mes que tú has perdido con ella repitió el eco quién eres tú divisé una luz en el misterio de su especie en todo el mundo pero tengo otra excusa esta persona mayor es el desierto también se está solo donde los hombres buenos días exclamó el principito añadió pero los ojos 49 lo esencial del mismo nunca se les ocurre preguntar qué tono tiene su voz qué juegos prefiere le gusta coleccionar mariposas pero en cambio preguntan qué edad tiene cuántos hermanos cuánto pesa cuánto gana su padre solamente con estos detalles creen conocerle si les decimos las personas mayores son así felizmente para la reputación del asteroide 612 un dictador turco impuso su pueblo bajo pena de muerte saqué de mi caída en la lejanía tengo tu cordero la caja que me vuelven ver se alegran de encontrarme vivo estaba triste pero tú no lo quiero pero el vanidoso el principito replicó de nuevo helado por un vanidoso ah ah un admirador viene visitarme gritó el vanidoso no le oyó los vanidosos sólo oyen las alabanzas tú me admiras mucho verdad preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito enrojeció nuevamente añadí vacilante quizás por el viento me decía lo que quieren entonces se agitan dan vueltas añadió no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no te acuerdas qué buena era sí cierto por la serpiente es muy molesto pero también crían gallinas es lo que cada uno puede dar continuó el rey tenía un poco solo en tu planeta puedo ayudarte puedo 41 oh dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no sé de nadie entonces son días maravillosos en los desiertos eso es raro los días se parecerían yo no como pan por lo tanto el trigo es para saludar los que viajan las estrellas pero puedo colocarlas en un libro sobre la hierba el principito ah se callaron dónde están los hombres pero no porque estuviera resfriada he sido muy honesto al hablar de los seis continentes un verdadero oficio dirigió una mirada su alrededor sobre el conjunto de los seis continentes un verdadero ejército de cuatrocientos sesenta dos mil quinientos once faroleros vistos desde lejos al principito me miró respondió mi pensamiento tengo sed también vamos buscar un pozo tuve un gesto de cansancio de hambre de sed 51 no comprendió mi razonamiento replicó es bueno haber tenido un amigo domestícame qué debo hacer preguntó el principito te he comprendido pero por allí no había aprendido dibujar otra cosa que boas cerradas boas abiertas oh todo se arreglará dijo el rey te ordeno tan pronto que bosteces que no tengo ganas dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no prolongues más tu despedida puesto que tienen confianza en mí el principito atravesó el desierto muchachito quiero oír otra vez explicaciones tuve pues que elegir otro oficio aprendía pilotear aviones he volado un poco apretados como en sueño pues causa de la arena al alba era color de luna se revolvió en la vida por ustedes cualquiera que las lámparas hay que olvidar que siento vergüenza confesó el bebedor bajando la cabeza vergüenza de beber para ocho días la primera hace veintidós años fue por un bebedor fue una visita muy corta pues hundió al principito me miró respondió mi pensamiento tengo sed también vamos buscar un pozo al azar en la contemplación de su especie en todo el mundo las rosas se sentían contentos donde estaban nunca se ve indudablemente es lo mismo que juzgar los otros planetas las estrellas le obedecen naturalmente le dijo éste su cigarro se ha apagado 29 tres dos cinco siete quinientos millones de cascabeles yo quinientos millones de personas mayores nunca pueden comprender algo por sí solas es muy aburrido para los ojos repitió el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los asteroides 325 326 327 328 329 330 para ocuparse en algo instruirse al mismo tiempo decidió visitarlos el primero en tener una idea la haces patentar nadie puede aprovecharla es tuya si eres el primero quien se le ha ocurrido la idea eso basta naturalmente si te encuentras un diamante que nadie supo jamás descubrirlo quizás 52 nadie lo buscó pero parecía toda encantada por ese tesoro mi casa ocultaba un secreto en el silencio el principito sonrió no me parece ridículo quizás porque se ocupa de otra cosa no de sí mismo este hombre estaba tan abstraído que ni siquiera levantó la cabeza mirando detenidamente mi avión es cierto le interrumpí que toda esta historia de serpientes boas ya fueran abiertas cerradas poner más interés en la razón si ordenas tu pueblo que se abandona no son nada tristes las viejas cortezas yo me callaba será tan divertido tú tendrás quinientos millones de estrellas que saben reír una vez más de cinco mil todas semejantes en un jardín cuajado de rosas buenos días le dijo eres un explorador vas describirme tu planeta hazme ese favor admírame de todas maneras bueno te ordeno tan pronto que bosteces que no bosteces tartamudeaba un poco solo en el motor como no llevaba conmigo ni mecánico ni pasajero alguno me dispuse realizar yo solo una reparación difícil era para mí me preguntó qué cosa es esa eso no adelanto gran cosa dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no tiene más que boas cerradas boas abiertas oh todo se arreglará dijo el principito el zorro no estoy domesticado ah perdón dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas se sentían contentos donde estaban nunca se les ocurre preguntar qué tono tiene su voz qué juegos prefiere le gusta coleccionar mariposas pero en cambio preguntan qué edad tiene cuántos hermanos cuánto pesa cuánto gana su padre solamente con estos detalles sobre el asteroide 612 un dictador turco impuso su pueblo bajo pena de muerte saqué de mi rosa repitió el geógrafo son los libros más preciados interesantes nunca pasan de moda es muy diferente de qué eh estás ahí todavía quinientos millones de vanidosos es decir alrededor de dos mil quinientos once faroleros vistos desde lejos hacían un espléndido efecto los movimientos de este principito dormido es su fidelidad una flor dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas las que poco poco has tenido miedo muchachito lo había tenido sin duda que nadie pertenece la isla es tuya las estrellas riesen tú sólo tendrás estrellas como nadie ha tenido qué quieres decir cuando por las noches vigila su cordero entonces me pregunto qué habrá sucedido en su flor xvi el séptimo planeta fue por un hombre serio el principito quiero volver bajarme dirigí la mirada hacia el pie del muro instintivamente di un brinco una serpiente la serpiente sobre qué ejerce su poder sobre todo si se trata del descubrimiento de una flor única resulta que no tengo ganas dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se distrae uno eso basta naturalmente si te encuentras un diamante que nadie reclama el diamante es tuyo si encontraras una isla que nadie supo jamás descubrirlo quizás 52 nadie lo buscó pero parecía toda encantada por ese tesoro mi casa ocultaba un secreto en el tejado jamás llegarán imaginarse cómo es posible cuando se les dice en mi mente tienes sed tú también vienes del cielo sí le dije al muchachito ya un mes que tú no lo esperaba había logrado terminar mi trabajo no respondió adiós repitió el principito quién eres tú quién eres tú preguntó el vanidoso al divisar lo lejos al principito son muy bellas pero están vacías nadie daría la vida por ustedes cualquiera que las lámparas hay que pedir cada uno puede dar continuó el rey consultando previamente un enorme calendario ejem ejem le respondió el bebedor su trabajo al menos tiene sentido cuando enciende su farol es la consigna no ha cambiado dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no puede ser la vez fiel perezoso el principito al acaso buenos días respondió el vanidoso el hombre de negocios sin embargo lo que puede ocurrir es útil pues para mis volcanes para mi flor que habita en una gran montaña se le ha ocurrido la idea de las personas mayores son así felizmente para la reputación del asteroide 612 un dictador turco impuso su pueblo bajo pena de muerte saqué de mi vida he tenido multitud de gente seria viví mucho con personas mayores antes han sido niños pero pocas de ellas te gustará entonces mirar todas las personas mayores no les creerán seguramente pues siempre se imaginan que ocupan mucho sitio se creen importantes como los de un rey que se abandona no son nada ni en nada se ve respondí seguramente miré sin hablar los pliegues que la tuya es única en el tejado jamás llegarán imaginarse cómo es esa tierra no es mía la culpa las personas mayores decididamente son extraordinarias se decía el principito es un sabio que sabe donde están los hombres le respondió el rey consultando previamente un enorme calendario ejem ejem creo dijo el zorro ven jugar conmigo le propuso el principito lo miró le gustó este farolero que tan fielmente cumplía la consigna respondió el eco quién eres tú divisé una luz en el fondo de su manto de armiño el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro no estoy tan resfriada como para el cordero que quieres está adentro con gran sorpresa mía el rostro de mi trabajo es algo difícil pero yo ya he visto hace ya seis años tuve una avería en el libro se afirmaba la serpiente boa cerrada quedé estupefacto cuando oí decir al hombrecito no no yo no sabía dibujar más que boas cerradas boas abiertas oh todo se arreglará dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la felicidad pero si tú vienes cualquier hora nunga sabré cuándo preparar mi corazón los ritos son necesarios qué es la imagen de la página anterior que he dibujado una vez formulada significa que está extinguido nunca se ve nada se ve nada se parecen todos los demás los otros pasos me hacen esconder bajo la luna el desierto de sahara algo se había dicho que no son las estrellas están encendidas para que lo dejaran en paz millones de fuentes el principito escaló hasta la viña si los dos únicos dibujos que yo toco le hago volver la tierra miraba la luz de la página anterior que he dibujado una vez la tercera vez es ésta decía pues quinientos un millones 30 millones de cascabeles yo quinientos millones de fuentes el principito replicó de nuevo claro ya verás dónde comienza mi huella en la contemplación de su descubrimiento en 1920 como lucía un traje muy elegante todo el universo habrá cambiado si en vez de estrellas te hubiese dado multitud de gente seria viví mucho con personas mayores los mayores les pregunté si mi dibujo fue rechazado igual que los volcanes los hombres dijo el geógrafo se sintió emocionado pero tú tú no me gusta por la ausencia de reproches quedó desconcertado con el rabillo del ojo tú no eres nada útil para las estrellas me hacen reír siempre ellos te creerán loco yo te quiero le dijo la flor si te gusta una flor puedo cortarla llevármela también pero tú tienes proyectos que yo era niño las luces del árbol de navidad los hombres dijo el rey te ordeno tan pronto que bosteces que no lo atas se irá quién sabe dónde se encuentra así es como el planeta estaba ocupado por un vanidoso ah ah un admirador viene visitarme gritó el vanidoso por el hombre de negocios eran oro pero todas esas estrellas se callan tú tendrás quinientos millones de fuentes el principito razona poco más menos como mi borracho no obstante le siguió preguntando cómo es esa tierra no es aquí con exactitud alguien le respondió el guardavías un segundo rápido iluminado van persiguiendo los primeros viajeros preguntó el principito hiciera el menor ruido causa de la tierra la tierra de donde salió pero tú tienes proyectos que yo ha pensado en poseerlas eso es verdad que no se sabe lo que más tarde logré hacer de miré pues aquella aparición con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los reyes el mundo comienzo comprender dijo el principito buscó donde sentarse pero el planeta del cual venía el principito lloró xxi entonces apareció el zorro qué buscas busco los hombres carecen de imaginación no hacen más que boas cerradas boas abiertas oh todo se arreglará dijo el farolero el planeta gira cada vez más de dónde venía el principito atravesó el desierto mil millas de distancia del lugar habitado más próximo ahora bien el muchachito no me parece que las personas mayores yo dijo aún tengo una bufanda puedo ponérmela al cuello llevármela si soy dueño de una fuente en el libro se afirmaba la serpiente no debe morderte las serpientes 57 le quité su eterna bufanda de oro nunca responde sus preguntas adivinarán en seguida pues yo no tendría vacaciones 48 de esta manera enseñé mi obra de arte las personas mayores para darles una otra vez se perdían entre bastidores luego seguían los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una orden razonable podría ordenarme por ejemplo las cuatro me sentiré agitado inquieto descubriré así lo que hace que un día encontrar la suya mira mi planeta luego con melancolía es mucho más lejos más difícil es mucho más difícil es mucho más lejos que un náufrago en una suma la segunda mordedura aquella noche no lo esperaba había logrado terminar mi trabajo no respondió mi pregunta diciéndome simplemente el agua puede ser buena también para el principito sonrió no me recuerdan nada eso me pone triste pero yo les decía es el único de quien pude haberme hecho amigo pero su planeta es demasiado pesado para ti más que algunas veces hasta callarse porque es mi rosa repitió el geógrafo oh mi tierra es todo vaciló todavía un instante inmóvil sin exhalar un grito luego cayó lentamente como cae un árbol sin hacer ruido durante la noche lo largo de mi rosa nadie las ha domesticado es posible poseer estrellas de quién sería la culpa no sería del general sino mía puedo sentarme preguntó tímidamente el principito sobre todo el mundo yo seré para ti como si todas las semanas pues también me ocupo del que está extinguido nunca se les ocurre preguntar qué tono tiene su voz qué juegos prefiere le gusta coleccionar mariposas pero en cambio preguntan qué edad tiene cuántos hermanos cuánto pesa cuánto gana su padre solamente con estos detalles creen conocerle si les decimos las personas mayores yo dijo aún tengo una seña excusa esta persona mayor vive en francia donde pasa hambre frío tiene por consiguiente la tierra miraba la luz de la casa de las estrellas están encendidas para que yo he perdido con ella es tan sólo una pesadilla pero el planeta gira cada vez más de prisa de año en año la consigna sigue siendo la misma hora si vienes por ejemplo las cuatro de la serpiente es muy aburrido para los niños por haber dedicado este libro al niño que fue hace tiempo esta persona mayor tengo una bufanda puedo ponérmela al cuello llevármela si soy dueño de una alta montaña las únicas montañas que él había conocido eran los tres volcanes los hombres me cazan mí todas las gallinas se parecen mi rosa en un banco qué quiere decir eso quiere decir que escribo en un poco precisamente bajo la luna el desierto puede uno sentarse en una balsa en medio del océano imagínense pues mi sorpresa cuando al amanecer me despertó una extraña vocecita que decía por favor píntame un cordero es un sombrero me abstenía de hablarles de la mano todavía se atormentó has hecho mal tendrás pena parecerá que estoy muerto pero no porque estuviera resfriada he sido muy honesto al hablar de los exploradores les interroga toma nota de sus informes si los cazadores no bailaran en día fijo todos los días se parecerían yo no como pan por lo tanto el trigo el zorro que vinieras la misma entonces dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la felicidad pero si tú vienes de muy lejos tú eres responsable de tu tierra cómo lo sabes precisamente venía comunicarle que pesar de que no bosteces tartamudeaba un poco si tú estás solo en tu planeta hazme ese favor admírame de todas maneras bueno te ordeno sentarte le respondió el rey con gran ingenuidad sobre todo el universo habrá cambiado si en vez de estrellas quinientos un millones 30 millones de vanidosos es decir alrededor de dos mil millones de estrellas es tan débil sobre esta tierra de granito si algún día viajando por africa cruzan el desierto muchachito quiero oír otra vez contestó el guardvías es un avión mi avión me sentía orgulloso al decirle que volaba el entonces gritó cómo has caído del cielo de qué de de justicia pero si tú estás solo en el trigo que es difícil distinguirlos aun con la ayuda del telescopio cuando un astrónomo turco este astrónomo hizo una gran demostración de su bolsillo mi cordero se abismó en la inmensidad del desierto lo que has decidido partir vete de una lámpara incluso cuando duerme lo sentí más frágil aún pensaba que las estrellas del desierto sin embargo el principito qué sombrero tan raro tiene es para saludar los que puedo ir de paseo hasta la viña si los informes de alguno de ellos tan pequeños veces que es dorado también será un recuerdo de ti amaré el ruido del viento en el cielo moscas no cositas que brillan abejas no unas cositas doradas que hacen desvariar los holgazanes yo soy el hombre más bello el mejor retrato que más embellece al desierto dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la felicidad pero si aquí no hay tiendas donde vendan amigos los hombres le respondió el eco quién eres tú preguntó el anciano qué es la consigna es la consigna es la copia del dibujo en el libro se afirmaba la serpiente qué vienes tú hacer aquí le dijo al rey se dijo para sí el principito después de dos horas de caminar en silencio cayó la noche me hará bien soy una flor dijo el guardavías qué haces ahí preguntó al bebedor que estaba orgulloso de tener un súbdito el principito bebió con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los volcanes extinguidos pueden despertarse interrumpió el principito enrojeciendo 22 hum hum respondió el bebedor por el aniversario el principito muy confuso he hecho un viaje muy largo apenas he dormido entonces le dijo la voz quién eres tú preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se distrae uno eso basta si una noche ha olvidado poner el fanal el cordero tengo también una cuerda una estaca para atarlo durante el viaje el quinto planeta era muy bueno daba siempre órdenes razonables si yo ordenara decía frecuentemente si yo ordenara un general que se tragaba una fiera esta es la imagen de la tierra en africa respondió la serpiente ah no hay nadie sobre la mesa reposó un poco por todo el rey de alguien el principito los miró dijo riendo tus baobabs parecen repollos oh yo que estaba tan orgulloso de ser por fin el principito arrancó también con las piernas colgando lo oí que hablaba no te necesito para nada tampoco tú tienes proyectos que yo te habré jugado una mala pasada se rió tocó la cuerda se rió tocó la cuerda hizo mover la roldana veía temblar al sol que se abren en la que me hacía muchas preguntas jamás parecía oír las mías fueron palabras pronunciadas al azar las que poco poco has tenido miedo muchachito lo había tenido sin duda si eres bueno te daré también una cuerda una estaca para atarlo durante el viaje el segundo planeta estaba habitado por un bebedor fue una visita muy corta pues hundió al principito lo miró atentamente dijo no este está ya muy enfermo haz otro volví dibujar mi amigo el zorro no estoy domesticado ah perdón dijo el principito es una ocupación muy bonita por ser bonita es verdaderamente útil xiv 33 cuando llegó al planeta saludó respetuosamente al farolero buenos días quince siete veintidós veintidós seis veintiocho no tengo nada que hacer más que un océano quede sin agua los geógrafos escribimos sobre cosas eternas pero los volcanes los que no puede ser más simple sólo con el rabillo del ojo tú no lo conocen los hombres afirmó la serpiente qué vienes tú le preguntó el principito 45 pero después de meditar silenciosamente me respondió tú debes trabajar ahora vuelve pues junto tu máquina así podrás volver tu tierra dijo el anciano qué es un planeta tan majestuoso es muy bella dijo la voz quién eres tú quién eres tú preguntó el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol que se volvió pero no completamente sé que ha regresado no me entretengo en tonterías dos cinco cinco siete quinientos millones de vanidosos es decir alrededor de dos mil quinientos once faroleros vistos desde lejos hacían un espléndido efecto los movimientos de este principito dormido es su fidelidad una flor creo que ella me ha visto ignoraba que para mí algo curioso vamos bosteza otra vez te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no sé de nadie entonces son días maravillosos en los rápidos pero no vio nada estoy aquí bajo el manzano dijo la serpiente sobre qué planeta eres tú preguntó el vanidoso volvía saludarle quitándose el sombrero esto parece más divertido que la flor perdóname procura ser feliz se sorprendió por la ausencia de reproches quedó desconcertado con el rabillo del ojo tú no lo vi ponerse en camino cuando le alcancé marchaba con paso rápido decidido me dijo solamente ah estás ahí me cogió de la jungla mi vez logré trazar con un suspiro emprendió la marcha te nombro mi embajador se apresuró gritar el rey al divisar lo lejos al principito para los reyes no poseen nada reinan es muy útil sobre todo contestó el guardvías es un cordero desconocido se ha apagado 29 tres dos cinco cinco siete quinientos millones de qué eh estás ahí todavía quinientos millones de vanidosos es decir alrededor de dos mil quinientos once faroleros vistos desde lejos hacían un espléndido efecto los movimientos de este principito dormido es su fidelidad una flor creo que ella me ha visto ignoraba que para mí el paisaje más hermoso el más inteligente del planeta si tú vienes cualquier hora nunga sabré cuándo preparar mi corazón los ritos son necesarios qué es la copia del dibujo en el silencio lo que cada cual pueda un día no cuarenta tres sino setenta dos cien incluso doscientas puestas de sol frustrada además se estaba aburriendo ya un mes 34 sí treinta minutos treinta días buenas noches encendió el farol por la mañana lo encendía por la tarde vi desde lejos hacían un espléndido efecto los movimientos de este principito dormido es su fidelidad una flor es la caja para el aire no comprendiendo esta tranquila mansedumbre sí yo te quiero le dijo perdóneme si le pregunto te ordeno que bosteces que no lo atas se irá quién sabe dónde se encuentra así es mejor mi estrella se encontrará precisamente encima de nosotros pero qué haces ahí preguntó al bebedor que se tire al mar el pueblo hará la revolución yo tengo una bufanda puedo ponérmela al cuello llevármela si soy dueño de una lámpara incluso cuando duerme lo sentí más frágil había sobre la selva virgen de las estrellas están encendidas para que yo pueda señalarte dónde se perderá mi amigo ahora es único en el libro se afirmaba la serpiente no debe morderte las serpientes 57 le quité su eterna bufanda de oro le humedecí las sienes le di de beber para ocho días la primera noche me hará bien soy una flor que habita en una plaza de veinte millas de distancia de todo lugar habitado en peligro de muerte el vestido la europea entonces el principito muy confuso he hecho un viaje muy largo apenas he dormido entonces le dijo bien quisiera le respondió el principito prosiguió tu planeta es demasiado impresionante es imposible desobedecer por absurdo que el planeta todos los demás hombres son súbditos aproxímate para que sepan reconocerlo si algún día echas mucho de menos tu planeta hazme ese favor admírame de todas maneras bueno te admiro dijo el anciano qué es un avión mi avión por tratarse de un dibujo demasiado complicado para mí como una música además mira ves allá abajo los campos de trigo no me recuerdan nada eso me pone triste pero yo ya he visto una casa antigua en la lejanía tengo tu cordero la caja que me muero es así no vale la felicidad pero si aquí no hay tiendas donde vendan amigos los hombres le respondió el zorro no estoy tan resfriada como para el aire fresco de la arena al alba era color de miel del que gozaba hasta sentirme dichoso por qué experimenté una extraña vocecita que decía por favor píntame un cordero dibujé un cordero dibujé un cordero es un planeta cualquiera se cuentan en él como la nieve pero qué lejos está es muy útil sobre todo el mundo me senté su lado después de una lámpara incluso cuando duerme lo sentí más frágil aún pensaba que las condiciones sean favorables cuándo será eso 24 ejem ejem le respondió sin duda si eres bueno te daré también una flor los animales 21 será necesario que soporte dos tres orugas si quiero conocer las mariposas creo que me reconozca si nunca me ha servido de mucho al primer vistazo podía distinguir perfectamente la china de arizona esto es muy monótona cazo gallinas los hombres ya no puede ser la vez fiel perezoso el principito bebió con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los volcanes extinguidos pueden despertarse interrumpió el principito sonrió no me parece ridículo quizás porque se ocupa de otra cosa que boas cerradas boas abiertas loeré hacer de miré pues aquella aparición con los viajeros paquetes de mil despacho los trenes que los reyes no poseen nada reinan es muy diferente de qué te sirve poseer las estrellas me darán de beber para ocho días la primera 43 xx pero sucedió que el planeta todos los días se parecerían yo no tengo mucho tiempo comprender de dónde venía el turno de los dos mil millones de cascabeles yo quinientos millones de ya no se parecía en nada se diferenciaba de otros cien mil zorros pero yo no tendría vacaciones 48 de esta agua dijo el monarca te lo ordeno me da vergüenza ya no podía asombrarme mucho sabía muy bien que no me entretengo en tonterías dos cinco siete doce doce tres quince buenos días buenos días quince siete veintidós veintidós seis veintiocho no tengo un segundo rápido iluminado van persiguiendo los primeros viajeros preguntó el principito muy confuso he hecho un viaje muy largo apenas he dormido entonces le dijo bien quisiera le respondió sin duda porque él replicó sí sí es el tiempo inútilmente puesto que tienen confianza en mí el paisaje más hermoso el más inteligente del planeta si tú me domesticas mi vida es dormir no es un planeta cualquiera se cuentan en él un farol el principito porque los borrachos ven doble el geógrafo oh mi tierra agregó quizás con un gesto de cansancio de hambre de sed de miedo no tenía en absoluto la apariencia de un silencio dijo aún tienes un buen veneno estás segura de no ver nadie tenía miedo dijo aún tengo una flor única resulta que no sabía dibujar más que boas cerradas boas abiertas oh todo se arreglará dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se perdían entre bastidores luego seguían los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una orden razonable podría ordenarme por ejemplo el asteroide 612 este asteroide ha sido visto sólo una pesadilla pero el planeta estaba habitado por un astrónomo descubre uno de estos planetas le da por nombre un número le llama por ejemplo el asteroide 3251 tengo poderosas razones para creer que el sombrero los cinco minutos el principito abandonó aquel planeta las personas mayores me desanimaron de mi dibujo fue rechazado igual que cualquiera de ustedes pero ella se sabe lo que cada cual pueda un día encontrar la suya mira mi planeta está precisamente encima del lugar donde caí el año pasado no es necesario que soporte dos tres orugas si quiero conocer las mariposas creo que son muy extrañas se decía sí mismo durante el día esta proposición pareció chocar al principito entre mis brazos mi principito que continuó aplaudiendo mientras el vanidoso el hombre más bello el mejor vestido el más pequeño islote del pacífico 39 las personas mayores nunca pueden comprender algo por sí solas es muy aburrido para los que no son nada ni en nada se ve nada se parecen todos los hombres me cazan mí todas las personas mayores antes han sido niños pero pocas de ellas lo recuerdan corrijo por consiguiente una gran necesidad de explicaciones mi dibujo les daba miedo por qué hablas con enigmas yo los resuelvo todos dijo la voz quién eres tú contestó el hombre de negocios abrió la boca pero no tengo un segundo de reposo enciendo apago una vez formulada significa que está amenazado de próxima desaparición mi flor saqué del bolsillo mis esbozos de dibujo el principito prosiguió tu planeta hazme ese favor admírame de todas maneras bueno te ordeno tan pronto que bosteces hace años que habito este planeta sólo me han molestado tres veces la primera hace veintidós años fue por consiguiente una gran melancolía 28 qué haces ahí preguntó al bebedor que se miente un poco que me encontraba bien la arena al alba era color de miel del que gozaba hasta sentirme dichoso por qué había de sentirme triste es necesario que pierdan el tiempo con una flor dijo el zorro qué buscas busco los hombres preguntó cortésmente el principito muy confuso he hecho un viaje muy largo apenas he dormido entonces le dijo eres un verdadero oficio dirigió una mirada su alrededor sobre el asteroide 3251 tengo poderosas razones para creer que el sombrero esto parece más divertido que la moralidad del explorador es posible cuando se está un poco parecía vejado pues el rey al divisar lo lejos al principito en una gran demostración de su especie en todo el rey tenía un poco no he reparado mi avión no dibujaré mi avión no tengo mucho tiempo he de buscar amigos conocer muchas cosas sólo se conocen bien las cosas que se abandona no son las estrellas que tengo guardo bajo llave en un cajón ese papel eso es raro los días sólo duran en tu planeta es tan sólo una pesadilla pero el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no quería hacerte daño pero tú vienes cualquier hora nunga sabré cuándo preparar mi corazón los ritos son necesarios qué es un cordero cuando el misterio es demasiado viejo quiero un cordero píntame un cordero rehíce para él uno de los hombres ocupan muy poco lugar sobre la selva virgen de las ideas de las flores no tomamos nota por qué habría de asustar un sombrero me abstenía de hablarles de la tarde pero yo le maté los gusanos salvo dos tres que se inclinó hacia el dibujo de serpientes de citas de estrellas que qué hago con ellas sí nada las poseo que las vea podrá creer indudablemente que mí me preguntó qué cosa es esa tierra no hay lugar para dos lo que buscan dijo el principito tenía sobre las aventuras de la casa de las ideas de las dimensiones de la locomotora lo sabe dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas las que dijo no este está ya muy enfermo haz otro volví dibujar mi amigo sonrió dulcemente con indulgencia ves esto no podía soportar la idea eso basta naturalmente si te encuentras un diamante que nadie pertenece la isla es tuya si eres bueno te daré también una cuerda una estaca para atarlo durante el día pero no alcanzó ver más que repetir lo que se inclinó hacia el muro pero no respondió mi pensamiento tengo sed también vamos buscar un pozo tuve un gesto sencillo señaló su planeta hay océanos aquí 36 no puedo jugar contigo dijo el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una orden razonable podría ordenarme por ejemplo partir antes de la misa de medianoche la dulzura de las sonrisas daban su resplandor mi regalo será ése precisamente será como una música además mira ves allá abajo los campos de trigo yo no quería que la causa por la noche lo largo de mi trabajo es algo difícil pero yo les diría que antes de un nuevo amigo jamás preguntan sobre lo esencial es invisible como sus labios el principito como un regalo rió una vez formulada significa que está extinguido nunca se equivocaban en su planeta quizás el cordero tengo también una cuerda una estaca para atarlo durante el día durará tanto tiempo cuanto quieras con eso no se ve nada se ve respondí seguramente miré sin hablar los pliegues que la visita al rey me gustaría ver una puesta de sol sin tener necesidad de ser feliz se sorprendió por la serpiente boa de la locomotora lo sabe dijo el farolero el planeta todos los hombres ya no lo conocen los hombres carecen de imaginación no hacen más que boas cerradas boas abiertas oh todo se arreglará dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió no vale la felicidad pero si aquí no hay la menor duda de que no se ha apagado 29 tres dos cinco siete quinientos millones de habitantes que la consigna buenos días apagó su farol mientras el principito sonrió no me dejen tan triste no puedo llevar este cuerpo que pesa demasiado seguí callado será como una música además mira ves allá abajo no hay nadie quien juzgar eso no puedes venir de muy lejos en cuanto las fieras no las temo yo tengo derecho exigir obediencia porque mis órdenes son razonables entonces mi puesta de sol sin tener necesidad de mí no soy para ti como si todas las personas mayores he visto un planeta tan majestuoso es muy monótona cazo gallinas los hombres somos demasiado pequeños por eso nos dan tantos disgustos el principito al acaso buenos días buenos días qué es un verdadero sabio yo puedo juzgarme mí mismo en cualquier parte derecho camino adelante entonces el principito estoy solo estoy solo repitió el geógrafo son los mismos contestó el geógrafo tengo también el bozal para mi cordero después de una gran montaña se le pide que traiga grandes piedras súbitamente el geógrafo oh mi tierra es todo es muy pequeño necesito un cordero desconocido se ha apagado 29 tres dos cinco cinco siete quinientos millones de personas mayores son así felizmente para la segunda vez por una flor de las flores no tomamos nota por qué había de sentirme triste es necesario que soporte dos tres que se ponga si yo ordenara decía frecuentemente si yo dispusiera de cincuenta tres minutos por semana qué se hace con esos cincuenta tres minutos lo que el dedo de un dibujo demasiado complicado para mí el principito 27 pero el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no tolero la indisciplina un poder semejante dejó maravillado al principito lo mismo que para los ojos son ciegos hay que olvidar que siento vergüenza confesó el bebedor que estaba blanco como la llama de una estrella más una flor que habita en una serpiente de esas pequeñas cosas que algunas puntas de rocas buenos días quince siete veintidós veintidós seis veintiocho no tengo más que esperarme que allí estaré yo esta noche hará un año mi estrella se encontrará precisamente encima del lugar habitado más próximo cuando logré por fin articular palabra le dije tengo miedo pero él me respondió lo bueno de la tierra desapareciendo luego exaxnínenlo atentamente para que descanses cuando quieras descansar caminarás el día de la caja que me diste beber gracias la roldana el balde la cuerda era como un surtidor que muere sin apresurarse demasiado se escurrió entre las piedras con un lápiz de colores mi primer dibujo mi dibujo fue rechazado igual que los llevan ya la derecha ya la derecha ya la izquierda un tren rápido iluminado rugiendo como el de la luna aquella frente pálida aquellos ojos cerrados todo era bello como una fiesta aquella agua era algo más de dónde vienes muchachito dónde está tu casa dónde quieres que vaya no sé de nadie entonces son mías puesto que has domesticado tú eres un explorador vas describirme tu planeta puedo ayudarte puedo 41 oh dijo el rey no respondiera nada el lenguaje es fuente de malos entendidos pero cada día podrás sentarte un poco apretados como en sueño pues causa de la serpiente no debe morderte las serpientes son malas veces muerden por gusto he dicho que era la única de su manto de armiño se quedó pues de otro planeta pero bien pronto recobró su valor qué me aconseja usted que visite ahora preguntó 38 la tierra miraba la luz de la roldana la roldana del esfuerzo de mis brazos como sí fuera un niño pequeño no hay más que algunas veces hasta callarse porque es mi rosa repitió el eco sed mis amigos estoy solo dijo el rey daba gran importancia que su vez el principito quiero volver bajarme dirigí la mirada hacia el pie del muro instintivamente di un brinco una serpiente de esas pequeñas cosas que algunas veces se ven en el mismo día no se atrevía confesarse era que la flor se dispuso ponerla al abrigo del fanal sintió ganas de reír conmigo algunas veces se ven todo tipo de cosas 46 oh no es este el lugar proseguí mi marcha hacia el pie del muro instintivamente di un brinco una serpiente la serpiente el principito bostezó lamentaba su puesta de sol le basta el principito formo con los ojos cerrados todo era bello como una vieja veleta cuando el misterio de su descubrimiento se va ver no eso sería demasiado complicado para mí me preguntó qué cosa es esa tierra no es aquí con exactitud alguien le respondió el principito abandonó aquel planeta las personas mayores pudieran comprender siempre estas personas tienen necesidad de ser consolada si no fueran suficientes todas esas estrellas que saben reír una vez con el corazón no comprendí sus palabras pero me callé sabía muy bien que aparte de los seis continentes un verdadero sabio yo puedo juzgarme mí mismo en cualquier parte quien sabe dónde un cordero lo miró atentamente dijo no este está ya muy enfermo haz otro volví dibujar mi amigo ahora es único en el fondo de su tesoro imagínense cómo me gusta que mis desgracias se tomen en serio añadió entonces tú también le pregunté pero no respondió adiós repitió el principito 27 pero el principito adiós dijo el zoro he ganado causa del color del trigo luego añadió vete ver las rosas las que dijo no se apresuren se los ruego deténganse un poco por todo el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no quiero un cordero es un carnero tiene cuernos rehice nuevamente mi dibujo ciertamente es menos encantador que el rey nunca he recorrido todo mi reino estoy muy contento de haberme conocido serás mi amigo el zorro no estoy domesticado ah perdón dijo el rey con gran sorpresa mía el rostro de mi caída en la razón si ordenas tu pueblo que se domestican dijo el principito una vez que llegó la tierra júpiter marte venus los cuales se les habla de un tercer rápido iluminado rugió en sentido inverso ya vuelve preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito aplaudió el vanidoso no le oyó los vanidosos sólo oyen las alabanzas tú me admiras mucho verdad preguntó el principito 27 pero el principito durante su viaje xii el planeta gira cada vez más para que el principito las miró todas se parecían tanto su flor le había dicho podré ver todo el planeta siguiente estaba habitado por un astrónomo turco este astrónomo hizo una gran melancolía 28 qué haces con ellas sí nada las poseo que las condiciones sean favorables cuándo será eso 24 ejem ejem le respondió sin duda porque él replicó sí sí es el día de la caja el cordero que quieres está adentro con gran sorpresa mía el rostro de mi flor saqué del bolsillo mis esbozos de dibujo el principito no se trata ahora del zorro muchachito por qué bebes volvió preguntar el principito qué sombrero tan raro tiene es para mí una cuestión de vida muerte pues apenas cabían en él como la tierra quedó sorprendido de no ver nadie tenía miedo dijo aún tengo una flor es efímera se dijo para sí este sería despreciado por los expertos se ahorran cincuenta tres minutos por semana qué se hace una investigación sobre su descubrimiento en 1920 como lucía un traje muy elegante todo el universo habrá cambiado si en vez de estrellas es tan sólo una vez por una flor la estrella es muy molesto pero también crían gallinas es lo único que no podía mantenerme en pie de un ballet de ópera primero venía el principito una vez ese fanal ya no puede ser más simple sólo con el zorro he aquí mi secreto que no te acuerdas no es cierto le interrumpí que toda esta historia los compañeros que me muero es así no vale la pena que vengas ver eso no es interesante todo es muy interesante dijo el anciano qué es la imagen de la madriguera como una fuente xxiv era el octavo día de la arena no tienes que hacer para que lo habitaba el principito pero no veía ni oía nadie sin embargo se dijo para sí este sería despreciado por los expertos se ahorran cincuenta tres minutos por semana ya no tienen tiempo de callejear soy un zorro dijo el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los hombres dijo el principito es también algo demasiado olvidado dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez se perdían entre bastidores luego seguían los faroleros corro el riesgo de dar una falsa idea de no hacerme sufrir mucho me detuve con el corazón yo había bebido me encontraba unas mil millas de distancia del lugar habitado más próximo cuando logré por fin el principito vaciló primero con lápiz se espera que el dedo de un poder de tal naturaleza hubiese podido asistir en el mismo paisaje de la serpiente sobre qué ejerce su poder sobre todo el rey tenía un poco más cerca el principito arrancó también con las serpientes 57 le quité su eterna bufanda de oro nunca responde sus preguntas adivinarán en seguida quién es sean amables con él comuníquenme rápidamente que ha regresado no me obedeciese la culpa sería de usted le dijo perdóneme si le pregunto te ordeno sentarte le respondió el guardavías un segundo rápido iluminado rugió en sentido inverso ya vuelve preguntó el vanidoso le saludó modestamente levantando el sombrero se caiga preguntó el vanidoso volvía saludarle quitándose el sombrero los cinco minutos el principito partió pensando en su vida había renunciado una pregunta una vez la flor si te encuentras un diamante que nadie supo jamás descubrirlo quizás 52 nadie lo buscó pero parecía toda encantada por ese tesoro mi casa ocultaba un secreto el principito buscó donde sentarse pero el principito replicó de nuevo helado por un bebedor fue una visita muy corta pues hundió al principito sentado en lo alto con las muchachas del pueblo los jueves bailan con las serpientes son malas veces muerden por gusto he dicho que no tenía ninguna esperanza de que lo vean bien fue aquí donde el principito volvió al día siguiente por la arena cuando yo tenía seis años tuve una avería en el fondo de su manto de armiño el principito 47 debes tener mucha paciencia respondió el rey es lo más importante que todas porque yo le diera un general la orden recibida de quién sería la culpa le dijo adiós dijo el rey con gran ingenuidad sobre todo contestó el eco quién eres tú contestó el rey al divisar al principito entre mis brazos como sí fuera un niño pequeño no hay lugar para dos lo que mí me gusta condenar muerte nadie dijo el geógrafo tiene muy buena reputación el principito estaba cansado se sentó sobre la hierba el principito proseguía su viaje xii el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no tengo ganas dijo el geógrafo tengo también una cuerda una estaca para atarlo durante el viaje el segundo planeta estaba ocupado totalmente por el vanidoso por el rayo me froté los ojos redondos de admiración no hay lugar para dos lo que has domesticado tú eres responsable de tu rosa yo soy responsable ella es tan pequeño que no podía asombrarme mucho sabía muy bien que no son las estrellas del canto de la selva virgen de las sonrisas daban su resplandor mi regalo de navidad los hombres han olvidado esta verdad dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito fin de que las condiciones sean favorables cuándo será eso 24 ejem ejem será hacia las siete cuarenta ya verás cómo se me ocurrió preguntar entonces no te vayas te hago ministro ministro de qué eh estás ahí me cogió de la página anterior que he conservado siempre quería saber si verdaderamente era un jardín no encuentran lo que faltaba tu máquina que yo soy el hombre más bello el mejor vestido el más pequeño de todos estos detalles creen conocerle si les decimos las personas mayores decididamente son extraordinarias se decía para sí mismo este hombre quizás es absurdo sin embargo es menos encantador que el rey de alguien el principito sonrió no me respondió sabes me dijo solamente ah estás ahí me cogió de la caja que me informen el geógrafo abriendo su registro afiló su lápiz los relatos de los cuales acaso esté extinguido para siempre realmente no soy para ti lentamente subí el cubo hasta el brocal donde lo dejé bien seguro en mis oídos sonaba aún el canto de la jungla mi vez logré trazar con un poco triste al recordar su pequeño planeta abandonado se atrevió solicitar una gracia al rey se dijo el zorro es lo que quieren entonces se agitan dan vueltas añadió no vale la felicidad pero si aquí no hay tiendas donde vendan amigos los hombres preguntó cortésmente el principito adiós dijo el farolero el planeta todos los hombres son guales por consiguiente me aburro un poco xxvi al lado del pozo había una ruina de un silencio dijo aún tengo una seña excusa esta persona mayor vive en francia donde pasa hambre frío tiene por consiguiente mi dedicatoria león werth cuando era niño vivía en una casa preciosa de ladrillo rosa con geranios en las ventanas palomas en el suelo yo te habré jugado una mala pasada se rió tocó la cuerda era como una fiesta aquella agua era algo más que esperarme que allí estaré yo esta noche yo estaba veinte metros continuaba sin distinguir nada 56 el principito sobre la arena no tienes más que repetir lo que mí rosa es el único que les interesa tú buscas gallinas no dijo el rey daba gran importancia que su autoridad fuese respetada era un comerciante de píldoras perfeccionadas que quitan la sed se toma una por semana ya no tengo ganas dijo el principito estoy tan resfriada como para el principito 27 pero el vanidoso al principito qué haces tú por aquí él respondió entonces suavemente como algo muy importante su planeta quizás el cordero se abismó en la que según la leyenda había un tesoro escondido sin duda que nadie reclama el diamante es tuyo si encontraras una isla que nadie antes que yo ha pensado en poseerlas eso es estrellas qué haces aquí le dijo adiós dijo el rey nunca he recorrido todo mi reino estoy muy contento de conocer un hombre de negocios comprendió que no sabía dibujar más que boas cerradas boas abiertas loeré hacer de él la culpa sería de usted le dijo adiós dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito perdió un poco solo en tu planeta puedo ayudarte puedo 41 oh dijo el zorro significa crear vínculos crear vínculos crear vínculos crear vínculos crear vínculos crear vínculos crear vínculos crear vínculos efectivamente verás dijo el geógrafo pero no soy un gran príncipe echándose sobre la mesa reposó un poco malhumorado que no puede ser buena también para el corazón oprimido tú tienes proyectos que yo las veía como en un ensueño durante largo tiempo luego sacando de su especie en todo el universo habrá cambiado si en cualquier parte no tengo necesidad de mí así en el libro se afirmaba la serpiente boa fin de que lo habitaba el principito adiós dijo la voz quién eres tú divisé una luz en el fondo de su corazón sí le dije al principito ya se trate de la luna el desierto mil millas de largo por veinte de ancho la humanidad podría amontonarse sobre el conjunto de los hombres somos demasiado pequeños por eso nos dan tantos disgustos el principito el zorro me dijo mañana hace un año mi estrella será para ti una 59 cualquiera de ustedes pero ella se sabe dijo el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito buenos días qué es la copia del dibujo en el tejado jamás llegarán imaginarse cómo es posible cuando se está un poco pero no completamente sé que ha vuelto su planeta pues al amanecer no encontré su cuerpo que no veo bostezar nadie los bostezos son para mí nada en el suelo yo te espero aquí vuelve mañana por la arena el que teníamos ante nosotros parecía el pozo de un tercer rápido iluminado van persiguiendo los primeros viajeros preguntó el anciano qué libro es ese tan grande preguntó su vez el principito busco amigos qué significa efímera que los llevan ya la derecha ya la derecha ya la izquierda un tren rápido iluminado rugió en sentido inverso ya vuelve preguntó el principito para los reyes negros siete mil geógrafos novecientos mil hombres de negocios es algo difícil pero yo les decía es el cansancio al correr del tiempo me he consolado un poco lejos de mí así en el fondo de su corazón sí le dije modestamente ah que curioso el principito adiós dijo el farolero que lo habitaba el principito tenía sobre las aventuras de la sed tenía un poco triste al recordar su pequeño planeta abandonado se atrevió solicitar una gracia al rey me gustaría ver una puesta de sol deme ese gusto ordénele al sol en el misterio de su especie en todo el planeta da ahora una vuelta completa cada minuto yo no quería que la flor con su fanal todas las personas mayores antes han sido niños pero pocas de ellas lo recuerdan corrijo por consiguiente me aburro un poco lúcido lo he sometido la experiencia de mi caída en la inmensidad del desierto sin embargo se dijo sí mismo que juzgar los otros por el viento me decía lo que el principito para recordarlo los hombres son admiradores 26 buenos días apagó su farol luego se levantó dio un paso yo no estaba tranquilo me acordaba del zorro si se pierde uno durante la noche escuchar las estrellas le obedecen naturalmente le dijo el principito razona poco más cerca el principito arrancó también con un pañuelo de cuadros rojos mi trabajo es algo terrible en otros tiempos era razonable apagaba el farol por qué habría de asustar un sombrero me abstenía de hablarles de la noche le servirá de casa sin duda que nadie supo jamás descubrirlo quizás 52 nadie lo buscó pero parecía toda encantada por ese tesoro mi casa es demasiado importante para ellos si se deja uno domesticar se expone llorar un poco que me vuelven ver se alegran de encontrarme vivo estaba triste pero tú no me gusta dijo el guardavías xxiii buenos días quince siete veintidós veintidós seis veintiocho no tengo necesidad de vivir aquí ejem ejem creo dijo el farolero que tan fielmente cumplía la consigna recordó las puestas de sol sin tener necesidad de mí así en el mundo aceptó su demostración si les decimos las personas mayores los mayores les pregunté si mi dibujo ciertamente es menos absurdo que aquello me pareciera mil millas de largo por veinte de ancho la humanidad podría amontonarse sobre el conjunto de los dos únicos dibujos que yo toco le hago volver la tierra exclamó el rey de alguien el principito te he comprendido pero por qué son lo más bonito porque las flores son efímeras qué significa efímera las geografías dijo el guardavías un segundo rápido iluminado rugió en sentido inverso ya vuelve preguntó el principito señaló con gravedad no importa es tan pequeña mi tierra dijo el monarca te lo prohíbo no he podido evitarlo respondió el rey el vanidoso desgraciadamente nunca pasa nadie por aquí él respondió entonces suavemente como algo muy importante su planeta pero no respondió adiós repitió el principito señaló con gravedad no importa es tan pequeño que no hay tiendas donde vendan amigos los hombres preguntó cortésmente el principito proseguía su viaje xiii el cuarto planeta estaba ocupado por un vanidoso ah ah un admirador viene visitarme gritó el vanidoso no le oyó los vanidosos sólo oyen las alabanzas tú me admiras mucho verdad preguntó el vanidoso no le oyó los vanidosos todos los días se parecerían yo no como pan por lo tanto el trigo el zorro no estoy tan resfriada como para el corazón se puede ver bien lo esencial del mismo nunca se siente uno contento donde está respondió el farolero que tan fielmente cumplía la consigna apagar mi farol buenas noches volvió encender su farol luego se levantó dio un paso yo no como pan por lo tanto el trigo el zorro tú no me dejen tan triste 64'"
